Pack enough comfortable tshirts and shorts to accommodate for multiple changes a day. Don't stay in Accra throughout your visit.   Go to :  -Akosombo (see the Volta lake and multiple riverfront villas) -Tamale (Bole national park and Paga crocodile pond if possible in the upper east) -then Kumasi on your way back (Lake Bosomtwe, Kumasi royal museum)  The local cuisine isn't bad. Keep an open mind.  Not too sure about travel requirements. Best you reach out to the embassy or use a travel company just to be safe"

What should I know?,Adorable_Rub_8257,8,2023-12-07 22:46:28,"Reading all the comments here got me smiling. I am Ghanaian (currently in the university of Ghana (in Accra) as a graduate student) and I have never been outside the country. Most things you need have been said, so I‚Äôll refrain from talking much about those. I admire and applaud your effort to come here and experience life as it unfolds in a country on a whole new continent. Before you come, recognize that your experience would most likely not be in its entirety, similar to the experiences of others, and I say this on appeal to the account of a few people here, of their experience of the country. I‚Äôve had the opportunity to host a professor from UK through one of my supervisors, and he gave me a positive account of his experience of the country.  Food Assuming you have allergies, like you should in many other countries, ask about the ingredients used in any food before you eat it to attenuate the event of your body reacting adversely to food eaten. Ghanaian dishes are very sumptuous- personally, I love fufu. If local dishes are not your thing, we have restaurants serving foreign foods. Whether or not your experience with food here is delightful is also highly dependent on where you get it. As a general guide, you can refer to a considerable amount of word-of-mouth referrals and online reviews of food.  Transportation We have ride-hailing services like Uber, Bolt, etc., that you can leverage on as your source of transportation. They provide more privacy. However, we also have the local taxis (also provides privacy) and ‚Äútrotros‚Äù (mini-buses) (less privacy). To travel very long distances, I recommend using larger buses at bus stations. Taxi drivers, to a large extent have discretion on how much they charge. Some may charge you more because your skin colour or accent to them, means you have money.  Safety Consider using a tour guide like someone said. Although Ghana is a peaceful country you‚Äôll feel generally safe and less lonely with someone by your side. It‚Äôs okay to be reasonably skeptical about the legitimacy of your friendship with the person you met on WhatsApp.   Well, it‚Äôs a wrap. I‚Äôd say more, but I‚Äôll leave it for someone else to continue. Remember, you will only be in Ghana for a short while; an opportunity that many wish their whole lives they‚Äôd have. So have fun."

I had a great time and I learned a lot. Lived in a village with a ghanaian family and very quickly integrated which was absolutely awesome. My knowledge on things like history is not too expansive but I do have a bunch of personal experiences and small random things I learned so if you have a question I can answer some stuff about people and culture :D  Until then, here are some random thoughts:  Food is great. Some I didn‚Äòt like, some I loved. Waakye and Kenkey were fucking amazing and I miss that taste every single day.  Travel is fun. The most utilized form of public transit is the Trotro, minibusses or large vans that drive along a route and either pick people up on their way or load up at a local station, something like a bus hub. Trotros are very fun mostly and one cool thing is that at large intersections or stops, market ladies and men will wait with snacks, drinks and really everything you could imagine. Once the trotro halts, its a whole shopping frenzy and ecerybody loads up on snacks right from their seat through the window. Its like a small snack pit stop and I loved it.  Last thing I randomly thought of: Ghana has some insane nature. Some is more touristically available like national parks, other things are basically hidden away. There are waterfalls and trails that would stomp a lot of natural sights in other countries but because there is so little tourism, those sights are almost always empty. Its pretty crazy and I really thing that if Ghana keeps developing, there will eventually be so much to see and so many cool things to witness. I was always sad I never got to experience lake volta much. There could be so many activities to do there, but most parts of the coast are barely even accessible. As a european, thats something that you just aren‚Äòt used to on our tourist filled and densely populated continent.  Thats it with my random stuff. I really really would love to answer anyones questions, the stupider the better."

Ghana is known for its rich cultural heritage, vibrant music, and diverse cuisine. One interesting aspect is its significant role in the transatlantic slave trade. Ghana was a major hub for the trade, with several forts and castles along its coastline used to hold slaves before they were shipped to the Americas. Today, many of these sites, such as Cape Coast Castle and Elmina Castle, serve as powerful reminders of this dark period in history and are UNESCO World Heritage Sites. Despite this painful past, Ghana has emerged as a beacon of democracy and stability in Africa, earning the nickname ""Gateway to Africa."""

Both countries are mostly populated by Akan people.  Akans in Ivory Coast are mostly from the Western region of Ghana and a mix with core tribes from Ivory Coast central region.  Ghana is very peaceful and socially united.  Ivory Coast is somewhat peaceful but have much more northerners than Ghana so there are social issues between south ivorians and northerners.  Ghanaians are more traditional and entrepreneurs and business minded. They have some of the best business men in West Africa along with Nigeria.  Ivorians are more westernized and office and university minded. They have some of the best intellectuals and engineers in West Africa.  Ghana has few foreigners.

Previous colonial influence made countries like Ghana and The Ivory Coast solely dependent on producing and selling only cocoa (for the price set by colonial powers), and that still remains true today. These countries have become so dependent on one crop that it is almost futile to try and deviate, which is why cocoa is so prominent in these nations. Fun fact though: If you see a sticker on a food product saying ‚ÄúFair Trade‚Äù, that signifies that the company used humane and reasonable means to produce their product and did not exploit workers (For example, some Oreo boxes will have this sticker)"

Ghana was actually in a union with mali and guine and had 3 stars on its flag when it got independence.

It‚Äôs hard to describe, but almost feels like a mob of people with torches marching from small village to small village, collecting more people and more fire are marching to the next village. I think we had 3-400 people by the end of everything.   The chief of each village will put some herbs and medicines in a kallabash (bowl) and bless it. Then there is sort of a mosh pit in front of his door way and he throws the water out. If it gets on you it can heal any of your ailments.   I might have some small details wrong.

Everyone seems to get it once a year or so, and you go to the pharmacy and get a pill regimen for it when you get it. It costs like $6. You're out of commission for a day or two and then you're better. The treatment is called artemether/lumefantrin if you're curious about it.  There is a more serious version of malaria that is present in Ghana but it is comparatively rare. You can end up hospitalized for it, similar to a serious flu. Accra has a decent hospital system, but it would probably suck to get it if you're out in the boonies.  And yeah once you have it in your system it can crop back up on its own for a few years. I don't believe it can spontaneously recur forever, but even if it does, is that so much different than e.g. shingles which we're all adjusted to seeing?  Truthfully I think the west blows it a little out of proportion because of its novelty. Whether you take the prophylaxis or not, chances are you'll be fine though."

It was a Toyota Corolla and was definitely not fit for the roads, we got a flat tire and had to get it changed in a small town. I was warned not to travel at night, not because it's generally dangerous but because as an American tourist I would be a target.  I didn't feel unsafe and don't mean to paint the country as unwelcoming, but I definitely wouldn't recommend just trying to take public transit, getting a driver is your best bet, at least in my opinion.  There are lots of small buses you see on the road, they are generally very full and from what I've heard are extremely uncomfortable. Some of the roads are alright, but some of them are very very rough. Getting from Accra to Cape Coast might be not that big of a deal though, I didn't get to that area but it's such a popular tourist place that it may be easier.

If you go to a typical lunch spot (dotted all over and frankly undifferentiated) you're going to get fufu with some sort of soup, or banku, or jollof and red red (plantains and beans). It's unsophisticated but edible and will keep you alive.  Personally I'm a big fan of all of those things (except banku, sue me) but it's totally not for everyone.  That said - the street food is awesome and tasty and sometimes weird and I highly recommend it if fufu isn't your thing. Random meats (often chicken, or gizzard, but sometimes roadkill - giant rats called grasscutter) on sticks or grilled in foil, tilapia, ramen noodles with your choice of toppings which for some reason always includes sliced hot dogs, egg sandwiches (you get a whole loaf of butter bread for like $1?!). All great when paired with a Star (local lager) or seven from the nearest bar.  Also, if you want actually good food that would pass some sort of culinary quiz, just take a weekend trip to Lome. They were colonized by the French so they have it figured out obviously. Great wine and coffee too, duh."

No, it cannot crop back up on its own, and it does not spontaneously recur in any case, ever. And it is most definitely not like shingles or worse, the flu. It is not a viral infection and you can be hospitalised for all types of malaria.   Malaria, if left untreated, will kill you. There is a reason it is literally the leading cause of death in Africa.   I dunno about the West blowing it out of proportion but there is certainly a lot of ridiculous and nonsensical misinformation about malaria going around and it is especially egregious when we have Google and Wikipedia."

I also like Indian and Southeast Asian (excluding Cambodian, Laotian and the Philippines) food the most (i find authentic Italian, French and Japanese food to zo bland tasteless though, so food is definitely something subjective and different for everyone ) and i have noticed that those cuisines definitely have more spice than what is used in West African cuisine, but despite that i really enjoyed food from that region and have gotten some incredible dishes.
