OG_rafiki,20,2023-12-05 08:33:14,"Travelling here between June - September means you'll meet pretty mild weather. Pack enough comfortable tshirts and shorts to accommodate for multiple changes a day. Don't stay in Accra throughout your visit.   Go to :  -Akosombo (see the Volta lake and multiple riverfront villas) -Tamale (Bole national park and Paga crocodile pond if possible in the upper east) -then Kumasi on your way back (Lake Bosomtwe, Kumasi royal museum)  The local cuisine isn't bad. Keep an open mind.  Not too sure about travel requirements. Best you reach out to the embassy or use a travel company just to be safe"
steepcurve,11,2023-12-05 08:55:53,"If you go to pub/club. Keep count on your drinks. Always make sure you know the price of the drinks you order.  Server will always add few extra drinks to your bill to pocket the difference.  Always ask for the price first. If you won't, they will always jack up the price."
Adorable_Rub_8257,7,2023-12-07 22:46:28,"Reading all the comments here got me smiling. I am Ghanaian (currently in the university of Ghana (in Accra) as a graduate student) and I have never been outside the country. Most things you need have been said, so I‚Äôll refrain from talking much about those. I admire and applaud your effort to come here and experience life as it unfolds in a country on a whole new continent. Before you come, recognize that your experience would most likely not be in its entirety, similar to the experiences of others, and I say this on appeal to the account of a few people here, of their experience of the country. I‚Äôve had the opportunity to host a professor from UK through one of my supervisors, and he gave me a positive account of his experience of the country.  Food Assuming you have allergies, like you should in many other countries, ask about the ingredients used in any food before you eat it to attenuate the event of your body reacting adversely to food eaten. Ghanaian dishes are very sumptuous- personally, I love fufu. If local dishes are not your thing, we have restaurants serving foreign foods. Whether or not your experience with food here is delightful is also highly dependent on where you get it. As a general guide, you can refer to a considerable amount of word-of-mouth referrals and online reviews of food.  Transportation We have ride-hailing services like Uber, Bolt, etc., that you can leverage on as your source of transportation. They provide more privacy. However, we also have the local taxis (also provides privacy) and ‚Äútrotros‚Äù (mini-buses) (less privacy). To travel very long distances, I recommend using larger buses at bus stations. Taxi drivers, to a large extent have discretion on how much they charge. Some may charge you more because your skin colour or accent to them, means you have money.  Safety Consider using a tour guide like someone said. Although Ghana is a peaceful country you‚Äôll feel generally safe and less lonely with someone by your side. It‚Äôs okay to be reasonably skeptical about the legitimacy of your friendship with the person you met on WhatsApp.   Well, it‚Äôs a wrap. I‚Äôd say more, but I‚Äôll leave it for someone else to continue. Remember, you will only be in Ghana for a short while; an opportunity that many wish their whole lives they‚Äôd have. So have fun."
MyRockMyRefuge,4,2023-12-05 08:52:48,"It‚Äôs great to hear you want to visit Ghana. There are a lot of interesting places to visit in Ghana such place include the Cape Coast Castle, the Kwame Nkrumah Museum, the Kakum National Park, Nzulezu( village on a river), the Kintampo waterfall, Buaben-Fiema monkey sanctuary, etc. The Ghanaian people are very hospitable and you would enjoy your little stay in Ghana."
PurpleDelaena,4,2023-12-06 10:06:36,"I don't know much about the friend you met on WhatsApp but from my line of work, be mindful of those people aswell. Some (not all) can scam foreigners or use them as their personal cash cow. So if you haven't met them in person before, be a bit careful.   Like I said, not all are like that but from my line of work, it is just an advise.   Nonetheless, most Ghanaians are very hospitable so just have fun and explore as much of Ghana as you can."
foddoye,3,2023-12-05 22:51:18,Get vaccinations for malaria and yellow fever  Make sure you book your accommodation in somewhere with good ratings not in Accra.  Find a personal taxi driver - most taxi drivers will know good spots in your local area so start with that.   Id recommend you visit Elmina Castle and Kakum National park
se1a,2,2023-12-05 19:37:46,"what‚Äôs interesting about this post is, what you need to see or try depends on the time you‚Äôre coming.  it‚Äôll be too hot to try some things in the harmattan (summer?) and some other stuff lol"
Dykumah,2,2023-12-06 21:46:44,"Ghana is a lovely place to visit. Your suggested visit months are great. Weather can get extremely hot and uncomfortable for your first visit. But you will be fine. Pack loose clothing, T-shirts and shorts and you will be good to go. Oh and careful of the whatsapp friend if said person is not someone you know personally. I wouldn‚Äôt play down scams. Best bet to having fun is to move with the tourist agencies. Its much safer and you get to meet like minded people. PS. I am Ghanaian üôÉ"

harryruby,1,2023-12-06 02:22:09,"I spent 2 weeks traveling throughout Ghana in 2021.  The stifling humidity is ALOT.  As in every time we stepped out of air conditioning, we were dripping with sweat.  I'm from North America, in a state that has high humidity in the summer, but i was not prepared for the heat and humidity.  I loved the country and the people, but I would not go back because of that.  I spent 2 weeks in Zambia a couple of years before that and found the temperature and climate to be much easier to handle."
ForPOTUS,1,2023-12-06 09:13:19,"Lovely country with warm and friendly people.   Just carefully organize everything tied to your trip beforehand, because things are not so organized here all of the time."
turkish_gold,1,2023-12-07 15:51:32,"It's actually hottest Nov through March in Ghana. Personally for me, December/January can be the worst because it's so dry."
mokojole,1,2023-12-08 11:39:44,Accra is a pretty fun place to be. Accra is where I live. Enjoy your trip.

shelly12345678,11,2023-12-05 14:14:29,I'll add: get allllll the vaccines and be careful where you eat. Skip salads and raw food.  (Source: I'm a Canadian who spent 4 months in Tamale with diaherria.)
ThePikol,2,2023-12-05 10:12:26,Thank you! I will check them out online and see what I want to see :D Multiple changes a day? Because of humidity? Is the food very spicy hot?
ThePikol,1,2023-12-05 12:37:58,What kind of shoes should I take with me? Sandals or covered?
ThePikol,1,2023-12-05 10:13:29,"Oh, that's good to know! Are the drinks expensive there?"
ThePikol,2,2023-12-08 06:37:49,Thank you very much! Much appreciate! If anything else comes to your mind please share more info with me :)
ThePikol,1,2023-12-06 05:34:36,Personal taxi driver? What do you mean? They are different than normal taxis? I can't use buses?
ThePikol,1,2023-12-05 19:42:35,I was thinking August or September. A week or 2 weeks max
ThePikol,9,2023-12-05 14:41:09,"First of all. Russia fight with Ukraine. Not Poland. We help them a lot. The most out of all countries. But we can't actively fight. Unless you want a World War  3 that is. Second, don't expect us all to go to war. I'm not a soldier"
neverarobot333,1,2024-11-05 18:06:46,What month were you there?
Aeon-V,4,2023-12-05 22:00:15,üòÖ it sure was memorable.
Standard-Kitchen4835,1,2024-04-10 01:54:00,"Hey, I‚Äôm looking to travel from Canada to Ghana as a USA citizen. What airport did you travel from? Also I just found out about the baggage issues and strike. Which airport do you suggest I travel from in Canada?"
OG_rafiki,2,2023-12-05 10:22:08,Yep... The temperature can be a bit humid and you definitely don't want to be musty in Ghana.  The spiciness of the food can be adjusted at your request.
OG_rafiki,5,2023-12-05 12:48:02,A pair of sturdy boots for when you're off road and a pair of comfortable sandals (Birkenstocks or any of that design) for the casual outings.  You can buy very cheap bathroom sandals when you arrive for lounging around the house.
Awotwe_Knows_Best,2,2023-12-05 13:47:07,drinks are expensive at certain establishments
immaseaman,1,2025-01-04 18:04:38,"Hey, I'm just looking at some ideas on a trip to Ghana and found this helpful comment you replied to.... Did you ever end up going to Ghana?"
Adorable_Rub_8257,1,2023-12-08 07:40:11,Sure thing! Welcome.üòä
foddoye,4,2023-12-06 08:33:04,What i mean is if you find a taxi driver that you like get their number so that you can always call them. You can use buses but please do not use the smaller vans even though they are much cheaper they are very unsafe.
se1a,2,2023-12-05 19:48:21,then the top comment is just fine. get a couple sneakers (air forces will be good) and then some birkenstocks for when it gets too hot or when wearing a shoe gets uncomfortable. the heat is pretty high and random.   AND WATCH WHAT YOU EAT. this the most important oneüòÖ
harryruby,1,2024-11-05 21:05:58,"August, which i believe is their ""winter"", lol."
shelly12345678,1,2023-12-05 22:36:14,Hhahaha the only downside. I loved it!!!
shelly12345678,1,2024-04-10 06:54:14,"I left from Europe, sorry."
turkish_gold,1,2023-12-07 15:52:26,"And by expensive, we mean like NYC slum prices.  It's not like they're $30 a shot.  Expensive places in Accra will generally feel like it's worth it. Except K≈çzo Restaurant (Japanese). That place is overpriced. Their drinks are watery. Their portions are small. Their menu is mediocre, and they seem to think seasoning is the salt and pepper you should add yourself at the table. Don't go there. Seriously. $200 a person for total BS."
ThePikol,1,2025-01-04 18:26:01,"Hi, not yet. We will see, maybe this year"
ThePikol,1,2023-12-06 08:37:08,"Oh, ok. Good to know! Thanks"
ThePikol,1,2023-12-05 20:00:22,What do you mean with the food?
se1a,2,2023-12-05 20:38:23,"there‚Äôs some food out here that would mess up your stomach badly. it‚Äôs good food tho, but it‚Äôll take a long time to get used to it. id advice you to eat food that‚Äôs similar to what you eat in Polan for a while"
