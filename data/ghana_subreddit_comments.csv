I know some of you will rebuff my assessment but look into the later years of his presidency. He began killing some of his political allies within his party. He slowly became paranoid and fearful of some members within his party. This is the part of Nkrumah they don't teach in schools in Ghana or generally speak of.

CIA tried to kill him multiple times and rig elections. hence he stopped voting for a bit and was paranoid since he knew many of his political rivals were CIA Western plants. American government wanted him dead because he was trying to nationalize his country and use the country's resources for its people like Libya. From what I read, Gaddafi's Libya nationalized and had 0 homelessness, 100% employment, and every time Libya made a sale on oil, it's citizens would get a cut of that sale. America created propaganda on how hes an evil socialist/communist and assassinated him. Libya went from one of the richest countries to the poorest after Gaddafi's death.  I also would like to mention, Burkino Faso has a young leader trying to do the same - Pan Africanism aka Nationalise it's resources and banks. CIA attempted on his life 16 times already.. you might ask, why does America and colonial power keep meddling with African politics? Because if African nations got together and worked for PanAfrican future the west would lose many resources that they steal for cheap. Gold, oil, cocoa, coffee, diamonds, cobalt, aluminum, etc. Africa is the richest continent, it has 75% of the world's precious minerals and produce."

Fascinating that every leader who has a modicum of success against colonial forces is described the way you speak of Nkrumah. Almost as if fighting against colonial imperialist is a bad thing, since obviously no black revolutionary leader can seem to get it right. Maybe, it’s best not to fight, since none of us can seem to get it right. I know! Let’s follow what the European tells us, since we can’t seem to figure it out.

If u truly believe that then u need some brain check. They are attempted over 40 assassinations on Nkrumah alone. Anyone who has been attempted that much has every right to be paranoid. Hence the stringent national policies. I don't see u calling out Erdogan for putting the nation in a state of emergency for over 4 years no election, no anything.

What an amazing coincidence that you couldn't refute any of the things I said. I mean all the debt traps of African countries taking loans they can't pay, what a horror. How horrible is it that I take a loan to start a business and if I can't pay back the loan, I can simply bemoan and blame the banks for debt trapping me. Poor me, I need more loans because the bank won't stop debt trapping me 🤓. What are the odds the banks are clearly trying to take down a savvy business man like me with all of these loans.  Fascinating that you cannot stay on topic so you attempt to diverge the conversation to other topics of absolutely zero pertinence. Almost as if fighting colonial powers like Gaddafi did by killing thousands of Libyan dissidents is a bad thing. Why won't the US just let Gaddafi kill all his political oppositions, they're clearly doing the bidding of the west and have to all die. Maybe it's best not to protest Gaddafi least he sics the police on the protestors with live rounds for trying to stop a great african leader from more extrajudicial killings. Let's just let Europeans tell us why extrajudicial killing is bad since we can't seem to figure it out.  I mean all the debt traps from China with Nkrumah looking up to Mao after he deleted 45 million of his own people with communism, we clearly needed that in Ghana. All the rigging of the democratic process by Nkrumah's administration with fake elections and fake votes on all of his referendums, locking up protesters indefinitely, disarming the police because he's the only one who needs protection and allowing the military to reel havoc on the streets. I mean they must be the greatest since they stole our natural resources and were able to increase their standards of living white our economy is sleeping on a sinking ship. The CIA was certainly trying to help Ghana when they travelled to Ghana on private jets and told Nkrumah to leave the office. I'm sure Ghanaians were not already disconcerted with his administration, I'm certain they were not tired of this demagogue that had declared himself God and was beyond reproach. I'm certain the same Ghanaians who cheered when he became president were not on the streets celebrating after his deposition.  It's quite evident you're not knowledgeable on this topic, however you seemingly purport your ignorance with such foolhardy proclivity it almost makes me impugn you as a bad faith actor. The reality is facts exist, how you choose to accept or conceive said facts is of little importance to me. When we have polarizing conversations like this, it is important that while giving opinions we do so in accordance with facts. You might certainly like to believe that Nkrumah was utterly unadulterated and never did no wrong, however if that were the case he wouldn't have been deposed by Ghanaians. You read that right, Ghanaians not Americans or British deposed Nkrumah in the same way Libyans deposed Gaddafi, not Americans. If you'd like to have a conversation about unjustly deposed african leaders, I'd be more than happy to talk to you about Patrice Lumumba, however neither Gaddafi nor Nkrumah were blameless, what happened to them was as a direct result of their own actions, not anyone else."

Labeling him merely as a dictator ignores the context of his leadership during a tumultuous period in African history, where he aimed to assert independence and dignity for his people, not merely to consolidate power.While his administration faced challenges, including economic difficulties and political repression, these issues were exacerbated by CONSTANT SABOTAGE, external pressures and the legacy of colonialism. It's miraculous he has achieved all this despite the thorns in his ways. Revisionist prat like you always seem to ignore context and spew asinine criticisms without acknowledging the broader struggles for African unity and dignity that Nkrumah championed."

I see it as invasion as America always builds military bases around the world and try to influence politics with presence of military force in key point locations. I also take ""USA staying neutral"" with a grain of salt.   ""After Japan’s surrender on September 2, 1945, the United States launched Operation Beleaguer, a military operation aimed at accepting the surrender of Japanese forces in northern China and repatriating Japanese and Korean civilians. Approximately 50,000 US Marines of the III Amphibious Corps (IIIAC) and the 7th Fleet were deployed to northern China, with instructions to remain neutral in the ongoing conflict between Chinese Nationalist forces and Communist forces.  Despite the US neutrality, tensions arose with Communist forces, particularly after the first skirmish between American and Communist troops on October 6, 1945. The US ultimately withdrew its forces from China in December 1945, leaving the country to its internal conflicts."""

I've asked Taiwanese friends, they disagree with what west have depicted. Yes, there were pockets of youth who wanted to break free to Taiwan - but many believe to be part of China as they have been throughout Chinese history. China isnt bombing Taiwan like the US did in Afghanistan for 20 years making the rich richer, drone striking citizens or send Israel 3.5 billion dollars each year since 1950s. Recently, US sent Israel 5 billion dollars to genocide Palestinians. I bet you believe in Ugyr genocide the US ironically ""cares about"", funny because US citizens and the west have been propping anti-Muslim propaganda since 9/11. Look at whats happening in the UK btw. Many   I used to believe in Ugyrs being genocided until I read what's truly happening rather than the US propaganda - Ugyrs were being sent to camps because they were practicing Jihad and were bombing Chinese places... the US was funding Islamic extremists in China as they did in west Asia to create ISIS.   Definition of invasion is: the act of entering a place in an attempt to take control of it. Which is technically what Usa has done; Operation Beleaguer   USA had no right to be in China to influence how the Chinese should run China like how Africa has many military US, French, and English bases influencing African Politics. If I was a government official and a foreign country landed on MY soil with THOUSANDS of armed personnel without MY people's consent, its an invasion. Which is why I stated eventually a skirmish happened between China and US because the Chinese saw it as an invasion. Of course Westerners don't see it as one. If China came to the USA right now and started created military bases with thousands of armed forces and vehicles in key points like DC, Texas, New York, Florida, California, Americans would call it an invasion. Anyways, I listen to geopoliticians from the non-west /non-European centric point of view. If you disagree with it, then just agree to disagree and move on."

Considering you're a connoiseur on China you must be familiar with Zedongs great leap forward that led to the Death of millions of chinese as well as their improvishment https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Leap_Forward. Considering the cpp improverished large swath of their populace, do they get to brag about better living standards currently because the eased some of their grip on their people by embracing the free market economy model.  You also made mention of China having more EVs than any country. China is the second most populated country so of course in term of raw numbers they'd crush other countries however when we talk about this types of data, we have to talk about them on a per capita basis as that provides a more realistic comparison. Essentially on a per capita basis, Norway has the most Evs of any country https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/40/Top_countries_plug-in_ownership_per_1000_people_2018.png.    Additionally you compared the US home ownership to China's home ownership, I wonder why that was the only thing you compared, why didnt you compare their economy? The US has a higher gdp and gdp per capita than China with only a fraction of the population. The US also has a higher median income than China https://datacommons.org/place/country/USA?utm_medium=explore&mprop=amount&popt=EconomicActivity&cpv=activitySource,GrossDomesticProduction&hl=en  https://datacommons.org/place/country/CHN?utm_medium=explore&mprop=amount&popt=EconomicActivity&cpv=activitySource,GrossDomesticProduction&hl=en .If we're gonna be comparing countries I could end this debate with an argumentum ad populum by simply Point out the fact that more people immigrate to the US than China. China currently has slightly under 1.5 million immigrants, the US has seen almost 10 million in the past 4 years with even some africans going through South America just to get to the US. As a matter of fact Ecuador tried to capitalize on this trend by increasing the price of their Visa for africans. https://homeland.house.gov/2024/05/22/startling-stats-factsheet-biden-administration-on-track-to-reach-10-million-encounters-nationwide-before-end-of-fiscal-year/ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_to_China#:~:text=According%20to%202020%20Chinese%20census,Hong%20Kong%2C%20Macao%20and%20Taiwan https://apnews.com/article/el-salvador-travelers-fee-migration-dd176d85871e54a9eb8695f8fb03a65d.   I'd like you to provide source for you claims of China lowering air pollution by 45%, I tried finding it but wasn't successful. I should elucidate that Chinas carbon emission has been on a steady rise. I'm not sure how you can bravely tout Chinas social harmony belief when they released tonnes of Beijing flood into several rural areas.  https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/08/31/china-floods-beijing-rain/   Amongst all the things you talked about, this was the most egregious of them. The fact that you'd comfortable lie that China has free speech and one can criticize them.   China froze the assert of a news publication that covered the hong kong demostrations criticizing the cpp and forced it closure. https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-57578926   China bans Winnie the Pooh because people compared it to Xi Jingping. https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/aug/07/china-bans-winnie-the-pooh-film-to-stop-comparisons-to-president-xi   China is the biggest jailer of journalists https://rsf.org/en/779-journalists-were-jailed-2023-547-will-spend-new-year-s-eve-prison   China bullies anyone who criticizes them. https://www.businessinsider.com/how-china-deals-with-dissent-threats-family-arrests-2018-8#9-forbid-you-from-leaving-the-country-9   China social credit score is nothing compared to the US credit score. The chinese social credit score polices people's behavior in every faucet of their Life. The US credit score system grades you based on your spending habit, it's literally not the same thing, I cant believe you thought this was a great comparison? I'd rather adopt the US credit system where I'm judge based solely on my spending habit rather than the government proactively trying to social engineer me into subordination. Imagine not being able to take a loan because you compared Xi Jinping to Winnie the pooh, or protested the government or even cheated in a video game or played too much video games. Considering you said it's not even that scary, it's clear who the ignorant one is. The ignorant one who compared Chinas social credit score to the US credit score. Maybe you should do more reading and less speaking so you dont expose yourself in such an embarassing manner.   ""I once too was anti chinese"". I'm not sure who you Think you have something in common with when you throw ""too"" in your statement but I'm not anti chinese as I do not hate Chinese people, I simply do not like the ways in which the chinese government reprimand it's Citizens because they believe they are above reproach. I'd like you to source the Bloomberg article you referenced.   Ultimately it's quite easy to deduce who the propagandist here is. You linked a Youtube video from a channel that covers China positively and covers the west negatively. I basically glossed over their coverage of the US and it was filled with nothing but negative stories however when I searched up their coverages of China, it was all positive stories which raised my Eyebrows so I decided to do some digging. I found out that the channel also had a website with similar coverage, ""The west and anything alike is bad and China is good"". Considering you get your news from a literal propagandist network and an extension of the cpp, it makes a lot of sense as to why you're misinformed. One thing about western media is they'll occassionally criticize the west, however Chinas propagandas outlet like geopolitical economy would never say anything bad about China, I wonder why.    Here's a grading for that propagandist network you linked. I honestly laughed when I saw their grading because I had never seen such horrible grades for a supposed credible media. https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/geopolitical-economy-report-bias/   I should also add I did see your other post about Nkrumah which I will get to at a later date."

Any African leader that has brought about seismic change through say ending colonialism or attempting to transform his country's financial situation for the better to the detriment of European and Eurocentric countries has been met with political insurgency backed by the U.S.A, Europe and their cronies.   It's no secret that the global economy is a competitive place.   A lot of people in the West are quick to point to China's soft power policy as a form of modern day neo-colonialism whilst conveniently forgetting that their own countries were literally built on brutal and dehumanising colonialism.   I agree with you that African leaders need to be aware and weary of Western leaders. African leaders need to be aware of Eastern leaders as well.   In addition to that I would argue that African leaders need to better coordinate on a continental level and close ranks when necessary. Our trade on a continental level has to gradually start taking  precedence over exporting out of the continent.   There are several things we can do to transform trade on the continent such as developing better trade routes on the continent. Naturally there are countries and economies that have to step up and take the lead but that is necessary in order to push the continent forward and to stay ahead."

People like to give the US all the credit for him being overthrown but completely gloss over the fact that hundreds if not thousands of libyans lost their lives trying to take him out. There were thousands of people on the streets of Libya celebrating after the confirmation of his death, how popular was he if people were celebrating him being deposed in similar fashion to Nkrumah?

If he wanted to not merely consolidate power, explain why he rigged elections and referundum votes to declare himself president for life? You can give him all the praises for his fight for independence, however his reign was horrible, that was why he got deposed by ghanaians, because they were tired of him promising the world and not living up to expectations while they couldnt physically hold him accountable because he had essentially outlawed presidential elections. You keep levying allegations of revisionism towards me but as i elucidated earlier, you still havent refuted any of my arguments, all you have is non arguments, adhonimens and vacuous verbiage.  The only thing Nkrumah championed while he was president was a horrible economy, purging his critics and consolidating power so he could created his communist utopia."

The US never invaded China. During the operation of beleaguer, the kuomintang party ran China and they collaborated with the US to have the surrendering japanese captured. Yes you read that right, the chinese government being lead by the national party kuomintang, cooperated with the US to have the japanese removed because they physically could not organize said removal as they had recently won the war against the japanese while simultaneously being embroiled in a civil war against communist rebels. The communist rebels where the ones who initiated the skirmishes, the US military simply went there to retrieve the japanese with the permission of kuomintang however the communists rebels who were not in power did not like the idea of external forces in their country as the external force were helping their enemy which was the nationalist party. The US wasnt at war with the Chinese government, ideally they would have rather avoided the skirmishes and could have easily escalated it to a full blown war by completely blowing villages to smithereens to get rid of the rebels however they opted out  of that. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Beleaguer    You made false allegations of US trying to influence China which furthermore exposes your faux knowledge on anything history related. As a matter of fact, the communist rebel only gained control of the republic of China after the US had left, so it cannot be an invasion if the current goverment worked with the US. Do you call UN military personals in Congo or Sudan invaders?   You analogy of China coming to the US to create military bases makes no sense as the US doesnt have such treaty with China, as I have clarified earlier, the US occupation of China was backed by the chinese government and the only people who had a problem with it were the communist rebels. As a matter of fact, kuomintang told the various villages/cities where the japanese troops were situated not to surrender to the communists, they were only to surrender the the kuomintang or the US troops, why would the US invade China but China tells the japanese to surrender to them? If it were the case that most Chinese wanted the US troops out, they would have met heavier resistance and not mere skirmishes.   Finally there's no agree to disagree on facts. If 1 + 1 = 2. We cant agree to disagree because you cannot have an opinion that deviates from facts and be expected to be taken serious. I genuinely implore you to do some reading so you dont keep making a fool out of yourself with your paragraphs riddled with arrant nonsense."

Ghanaians did a lot of the work kind of like Congo with Patrice Lumumba or Libya with Gaddafi.

In fact for anyone interested and with a stomach for ye olde English writing, I recommend reading Thomas Bowdich's Mission From Cape Coast to Kumasi (1819). As well as being one of the first British diplomats to visit the Kumasi, he also drew a lot of detailed illustrations of pre-colonial Kumasi and writes objectively about the culture.  The impression he conveys is of a sophisticated, clean town with a grand palace, and also a bit about the political machinations of Ashanti court.  He was also very taken with the idea that there were similarities between Egyptian, Abyssinian and Akan culture and wrote a book on that.  Foreign visitors to pre-colonial Kumasi were generally impressed. I believe much of the town was burnt and looted in 1874 to demoralise the Ashantis. But yeah, check out Thomas Bowdich's work and illustrations. His wife also wrote a book on their travels, which she gifted to Queen Victoria."

Your dad's family, mum, and even people who have no business with him might do stupid things and tell you that “it’s family business and you shouldn’t be airing it out.” Instead of doing an intervention for him, it’s you they’ll do an intervention for.  They might call you an unruly child, disrespectful, and mad. So while you are preparing to protect the children of your community, also be prepared for that same community to label you as a disruptive person.  So please find ways to protect yourself. If you are able to gather evidence and report him, try to figure out accommodations for yourself. If you are still in school, try to figure out how to finance it. Food, shelter, and transport are paramount for safety, so please take care of yourself too."

Postcolonial Ghana has lacked robust leadership and institutions for an extended period.  The Asante Empire was known for exemplary organization, with a sophisticated governance structure and accountability mechanisms spanning from individual families to the Asantehene.  Before the British destruction of Kumasi in 1901, British accounts state that the Asante Empire had impressive infrastructure, including the advanced architecture in this drawing, piped water systems, and storm drainage. Libraries housed books from around the world. Medical practices rivaled those in the West, with skilled surgeons and anesthetics. Even inoculations were observed, preceding its adoption in the US.  Unfortunately, the Asantes’ oral tradition-based culture means that written historical records are scarce."

In Asanteman, there was the use of talking drums, which served as an effective means of mass communication, even across long distances. This method fulfilled the need for public service announcements.   The Adinkra system did exist as a form of writing, but it was used in a very specific way—to convey certain axioms and proverbs—rather than functioning as a full writing system capable of expressing an entire language.  It’s interesting to think about, but we’ll never know whether without colonial disruption, the Adinkra system might have evolved into something more comprehensive, like Latin, Chinese, or Arabic.  As for your question about the preference for oral tradition, people tend to stick with what works. While I can only speculate, it seems likely that if stories and knowledge were successfully passed down through generations orally, there wouldn’t have been a strong need to adopt a different system until circumstances required."

I don't disagree with them because I've seen firsthand, but I always ask them whether they struggle to have conversations with me or our other female friends to which the answer is always a firm no. The issue is the kind of girls you choose to go after. Some have never had any issues attracting guys and there are some with the mindset that the man is supposed to lead (and they take this to mean he is to lead in every single thing) and so never bother showing any interest in what the other person says or asks.

Two of my little girls play “reporter” and act like they’re on the news, and put on a whole show. It’s hilarious and quite witty. But when my boys walk back in ,  it’s like my girls are literally not there and they act like they can’t even read out loud.   I don’t want to assume bc I’m not Ghanaian … but it appears they’ve been taught they’re not supposed to have interests outside of money, chores, and being subservient to men in their lives.

From a person who is originally from and raised in Ghana and have also lived in the United States for a little over 20 years. I came to the United States young so I understand exactly what the problem is.  Ghana is an English speaking country, mostly, so everyone you meet can hold a conversation in English. That being said, Ghanaians have a tendency to laugh at people for speaking bad English and sometimes even basic grammatical errors. Imagine growing up laughing at people who speak bad English or being laughed at. I am Ashanti, and there is a national shaming of Ashanti's for interchanging R and L when speaking.  When they meet someone from this side of the world who is naturally an English speaker, they are dreading making a mistake. Especially, if she really likes you, she doesn't want to make a mistake or lose a good guy through an event of bad English. Imagine meeting an Ashanti girl who has been laughed at all her life for her English and interchanging of R and L.  The best way to hold a conversation without making a mistake is to keep the responses short. It will probably go away when they get more comfortable with you and know that you won't be laughing at their basic grammatical errors.  You will come to know that, they actually speak with good grammar than most people in the western world because they speak English thought through books and not from the street.  Once they get comfortable, you won't be able to shut them up. ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|grin)"

Those same girls will however feel very free to ask for freebies/money etc. I think it’s an effect of the economic hardship in the country. There’s no longer real love/passion/enthusiasm. Everything is literally transactional. I don’t know you but I assume you are financially stable at least in the short term and so you have one problem sorted. For most of these girls the reality is they don’t even know where the next meal is coming from literally and this greatly affects their friendships.

Imagine, you have a 25kg sack of rice that you’re carrying as she walks beside you. You can’t carry it another step and you ask her to take a turn carrying the load, not even as far as you have, but just give you a break so you can resume. All she can do is look at you and suggest you both sit down until you can carry on with the sack yourself bc she just won’t partake. Whether she can’t or won’t, in the end, doesn’t matter. What matters is the conversation isn’t coming. Don’t bother trying to figure out why.  Check out while you can. The light is not going to come on anytime soon.

Then I heard him speaking our native language with someone else, and he had all this warmth and mirth in his voice that never crossed over into my interactions with him.   I think we need to give some credence to the fact that our languages are tonal, and that English is very mechanical, so even though Ghanaians speak English very well, the best conversations are had if you can easily code switch between a Ghanaian language and an English language.   As you might know, Ethos is carried in language, especially tonal ones. (Mome, norr are very simple examples).   Banter just feels funnier and more familiar with a little local mixed in.

If that kid grows up and fixes his life, he likely wouldn't care what government had to tag him as to save his life.  The only reason why this sounds remotely good is because of Ghana's broken justice system that thinks crime = jail, when it should be looking at reformation. This just appeals to peoples sensitivity (as we see in the comments) without fixing the issue. I'm sorry, but this isn't a forward step.

Sometimes we need to do away with our wants and activate our needs, I mean, things that needs to be done.  we all know that, this president elected won't do anything different until he proves us wrong, Regardless of who suppress or incite inflation, it's still going to be the same. But sometimes it needs to be stabilize.  The decision has been already made so let's entrust him, maybe he might do better this time.  There are a lot of things that needs to be done in Ghana but, they act ignorant when they are in power. They always tackle things they can't compete, investment in things that do not brings immediate returns , bridges, roads, building,  while they leave behind the country's production, Leaving behind the poor ,bad and old educational system that doesn't prepare us to become somebody by skills and practical , misusing human resources and many more.  I believe a country like Ghana should always think of production in all aspects, resources, shuffling our educational system to meet modern standards and more on production again and again.  If I may ask, When dollar increases,what happens if you want to stabilize it ?   we pump a huge amount of money to the economy to stabilize it,  Same question goes for what happens, when Foodstuffs price goes high? The government must increase Foodstuffs production in all aspects to neutralize the price. Peasant farmer can't do and even if they do , the price will still go up.  Assuming Government has big farms in all areas with respect to the kind of crops that grows the various areas and has employed our mothers and fathers who are peasant farmers in the villages to spend a minimum hours on a portion land acquired by the government. practice crops rotation with help of our Agriculture students.  Same ideology should be applied in all production sectors.  If the government ensure all these, and find out different ways to suppress inflation, Think of what will happen? But, they will act ignorant and tackle things without direct income.  All these can be done by people with intelligence, who are willing to take Ghana as their own business.  Let's see how this works"

Religion may have played a part in Bawumia's defeat, but I don't think it was a large one. At least, not for voters who think critically. The NPP was too arrogant, shutting down protests, calling the youth lazy, embezzling funds, sinking millions of dollars into a pit, covering up scandals, ignoring galamsey, etc. Even if Bawumia was Christian, he still would have lost.  Sad thing is, the NDC is going to do similar. This whole story played out in 2016, when Ghanaians kicked Mahama out and believed Akuffo-Addo to be a messiah."

This is not possible in our current two party system. It just exists as a facade. An illusion of choice. If you look at the history of other democracies similar to ours with the same voting system, you will notice that 3rd parties almost never win. They just can't because the system is built to prevent that. The best a 3rd party can do usually is cause run offs and be kingmakers.   So yes, as long as the system remains this way, this back and forth will always be the result and Ghana will progress more slowly. This is the best we can do. The system should change. Maybe we could introduce choice voting, limit how much can be spent on campaigns, etc. but thats highly unlikely to be implemented.  >Ghana already did that 8 years ago and yet here we are.

Never forget the US and UK had leaders who watched people die by the tens of thousands during COVID. They gave billions out in contracts, subsidies loan forgiveness to their friends.   Check out clips of Wode Maya's final video from Botswana released this week.  He is at a local university talking to professors and students.   He speaks to a young student and is staggered to learn the Botswana government pays all tertiary level  tuition  PLUS  all kids on campus receive 1200 Pula ($100) EVERY month maintenance and those off campus get 1500 Pula.

He had 2 doses of the fraud china vaccine but still died from COVID while staying the night at a brand new hospital.   Trust me, I'd pick Bots over Ghana any day but I've lived all over the world (US, Singapore, Finland, Botswana, and Ghana) and I know from these experiences that there is sadly no paradise on this earth.   Also I don't think voting for the right party will solve anything. Both sides are corrupt. At this point I wouldn't be mad at a coup. I'm not joking. Get rid of the entire current political class.

From top to bottom, Ghana is corrupt.  Look at the roots of the corruption. Religion is a scam (not spirituality) and a white Jesus has been controlling most Ghanaians (many of whom can’t even read). If the people are not able to see that the Bible has been edited and used to oppress them, what do you think happens? Pastors corrupt.  Pastors don’t teach Jesus’ actual teachings such as “Ye are gods” because people knowing they are gods would not be giving pastors with lambos money. This is all critical thinking which obviously is lacking. The roots of the problem lie (literally) in the trauma from colonialism/religion. That trauma hasn’t been healed. It shows when the eyes of most Ghanaian people light up when they see foreigners but not their own people. We don’t go from MansaMusa wealth to the corruption we have now without some serious intervention by the barbarians who could NOT beat us and so they tricked us into killing and catching each other (slave trade tactics). They have always used psychology. We have always been too trusting and yes some did fall for the okeydoke and turn against their own.  But TODAY, the corruption rots from the head as well. The country is hard so almost EVERYONE thinks they have to outsmart each other.  You almost understand the cops that stop you to ask for money. It’s disgraceful and sad. No govt officials, Drs, nurses, teachers get paid enough. Hell there are nurses and teachers that haven’t been paid in A YEAR. So imagine, if regular people can give the cops money, what do you think happens on a larger scale?  The politicians are so bold with it, as they steal billions, they don’t even have the sense or care to at-least create SYSTEMS THAT WORK. No one holds them accountable.  All we can do is be the first to actually fight for change, but that is not the nature of a Ghanaian. Tribal alliances (also dumb AF) take prevalence. Why keep voting for someone that gives you a bag of rice come election time. Does that nah last for 4 years? Lack of education is a gargantuan issue. Thing is, the politicians don’t want smarter Ghanaians. Luckily, Ghana has some of the smartest people on this planet but unfortunately they thrive in other countries. It’s ridiculously heartbreaking.  That submission where Ghanaians don’t fight, comes from trauma. Trauma that they have to “Respect” even the people cheating them. It also comes from religion. It’s dumb AF looking from the outside.  I’ve cried so much for Ghana but the thing that made me stop caring so much is when I hear Ghanaians say to me, “Yes, the govt is for stealing. And you are stupid if you get there and don’t steal too”.  I have a theory that something more spiritual is going on here but that’s another post.  I’m a logical person so I’m always looking for solutions but how do you uncorrupt the minds of people who are oppressed by intentional corruption that intends to continue to steal natural resources in order to keep Ghana and other African nations in debt? I’m no longer interested in hurting about it. WHAT ARE THE SOLUTIONS? If any. The only thing I can think of is like Kenya, the people get mad enough. But quite cleverly, Respectability politics makes sure Ghanaians wouldn’t dare. I honestly hope NKB wins because at least we’ll see a change between the same 2 parties that have been stealing and thinking Ghanaians are severely stupid for the past decades."

Let me explain. Just like any society in the world, Ghana has its share of unfairness. The issue lies in how individuals navigate this imbalance. Ghana has always had an elitist class, but the problem is that this class is increasingly distancing itself from the traditional Ghanaian way of thinking and living.  In the past, Ghanaian leaders looked out for everyone, not just those within their circles. Our society used to care for orphans, and the community played a crucial role in teaching and molding children. This sense of togetherness has been overshadowed by selfishness and individualism. While these issues existed in the past, there's now a noticeable chasm between the older and younger generations. The experiences of the older generation have shaped this divide.  A supervisor of mine, who is part of the elitist community, shared her perspective that young people today are unwilling to work as hard as they did in the past. I understand her point of view, but society has changed. In the grand scheme of things, she would likely favor her own children and those of her friends over others. This is not unique to Ghana; it happens everywhere. It is what it is. Hard work, perseverance, and a bit of luck might change things for those outside the elitist sphere, but until then, the future remains uncertain.  Ghana was once a beacon for other African nations after gaining independence. The workforce was dedicated to improving their lives and their families. Like any society, there were patriarchal and matriarchal norms that existed in balance. However, progress has come at a cost. I wish for a balanced system again, but individuals have made it difficult to trust one another.  I spent some time in Canada with a close family friend who was unwilling to hire Ghanaians due to issues of theft and backbiting among employees. She was more comfortable hiring from other communities. There are many questions one could ask, such as the wages she was paying or what exactly led to the backbiting, but these details are inconsequential in the long run. This highlights a broader issue with our generation. I understand that times have changed and doing the right thing is more challenging now, but it is up to each individual to do what is right.  Personally, I have often faced judgment for my actions and behavior. I consider myself an old soul for my age, working diligently without complaint and striving to be as honest as possible. I have my faults, but I have yet to see how this honesty has benefited me, aside from occasionally feeling morally superior.  When I ventured into business, I did not see the need to overcharge my clients. You can probably guess how that turned out. I also refused to accept ""tips"" for performing my regular job duties, which many viewed as disrespectful. Despite the backlash, I have not changed my principles. I will not steal from an employer by falsifying documents or overcharge clients because of potential economic changes.  I may be stubborn in my values, but I can live with myself, even on the nights I go hungry. The question is, can you?![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|grin)"

People all say, for example, that Ghanaian women only want men who have money and only sleep with men to get money.  Well guess what, that’s true almost everywhere in the world.  I know of very few marriages in the U.S. where the wife makes more money than the husband.  Women opt for wealthy men and are willing to please them sexually to maintain access to their bank accounts.  Maybe this dynamic is not as explicit in the U.S. or elsewhere as it is in Ghana but that’s just because, as this commenter says, Ghana doesn’t hide it very well.  But it’s still the way things work."

Females are evolutionarily tasked with species survival. The only statistically “true love” is that felt by mother toward child. All the other mammals are clear on this. Even a starving male grizzly bear although twice the size thinks long and hard before attempting to eat a female grizzly’s cub. He may succeed only to die later or be so weakened by his wounds as to become prey himself. Also victory is in no way assured.   Hollywood’s romantic love nonsense is simply a temporal trick of nature for sperm to meet egg. Hence the high divorce rate when humans are given the option to terminate one of patriarchy’s most enduring artificial follies.

I'd believe women getting more advanced education plays a bigger role, as it leads them to postpone birth till far later.

The level of education attained is directly linked to the number of children a woman has. It’s not linked to whether a man can look after her or poverty per se, as she can rely on government aid if that’s the case.   In the UK so many women from lower socioeconomic backgrounds tend to have children in their teenage years and out of wedlock. They tend not to earn much and do not attend university or even finish secondary school. Non of my friends who went to uni had children during our studying years and most of them still don’t.   With higher education attainment comes the pursuit of competitive careers which typically delays child birth for many women."

Yet we're rich at a global level.  Also the women being in the workforce is not all it seems. Yes women want to be in the workforce, but they don't all necessarily want to be working full time to the detriment of having a family. But many women have to work full time and have a smaller family because western economies have intentionally been set up to require a 2 person income to afford a home, bills etc which wasn't the case in the 1950s and 60s when a family could survive on 1 income alone.  But the most important aspect is not economic but cultural. It is now seen that 2 kids and done is the thing to aspire to.

We have people with vision, a strategic mindset, internationally-recognised qualifications and ability, but  who, because of our systems of preferment and the less positive aspects of some of our otherwise admirable cultural attitudes, will excel in other countries or in business or as educators, or as doctors, etc., instead of getting to work together on improving our country for the long term.

Is having a concert and Meagan twerking enough to just get the black vote?     5) Once upon a time, there were black families, less black gagsters and drugs. Democrats destroyed those things. If they were truly interested in ' helping' black AA, their neighborhoods and districts would be much better.     6) Kamala said she would do nothing  specifically  for black people.   7) Yet gave the Asians a hate crime bill because after a few attacks during covid. ( Yet no anti black hate crime bill)  8) Then have the nerve to demand black people should vote for her because she has a smidgen of black.  9) Finally the goal is to replace the blacks in America. ( AA have more abortions than any other) Look at the number of Latinos since 1950, Look at the increase in blacks. The increase is due to a lot of immigration.   10) Ask yourself why most Haitians are sent back from the border, yet the latinos are invited and given financial support.     11) Blacks in America need to go back and listen to Malcolm X.

Democrats wanted to close the border only if 8500 people crossed  To put this in perspective under Obama the cap was 1000, republicans wanted it to be 1000 Democrats refused.   They then claim the border can't be secured. Then why take 4.5 billion?"

That was a descriptor, not a case for why I was right. I’m not even trying to say I’m right. I’m just adding in more points for discussion than ‘look how stupid our fellow Ghanaian is hahahaha’. I’m reaching for deeper analysis on a meme post. Which does make me bloody stupid probably.  We vote on how our economies are structured and operated. Otherwise it’s something like a technocracy, where our leaders decide what’s right for us. Or a dictatorship, where again, the boss calls all the shots.   Africans are in the streets because of their economies, calling out their democracies for a realm of solutions. Taxes are too high, kenkey prices are too high. I’m not mad at the vendor tho, I’m mad at the policies in place that have us importing tomatoes from Niger and Burkina instead of supporting our own farmers. As one single example. An economy that is a result of political decisions. All economies are the result of the democracies they operate within. America spread democracy around the world not for the love of the institution, but to create new economies for western corporations to operate within.   IMF policy, monetary policy, resource extraction policy, military policy have economic consequences, but they are certainly also the result of how we vote, and who we vote for. Making them about democracy and economics. "

At 6'9"", you're not just tall - you're a walking opportunity! Let's chat about some cool ways you could turn your height into an awesome business venture.  First off, have you ever thought about getting into entertainment? With your stature, you could totally have a place in acting. There's always a need for super tall folks in those industries, and you'd stand out (literally!) from the crowd.  Speaking of standing out, why not dive into fashion? Imagine starting your own clothing line for big and tall guys. And guess who'd be the perfect model? Yep, you got it - you! 😉  But hey, let's not forget we're living in the digital age. Have you considered creating content online? It's one of the fastest-growing ways to make a name for yourself these days. All you need is a smartphone and a niche. With your height, you've already got something unique to build your brand around.  Oh, and public speaking! Your height naturally commands attention, so why not use that to your advantage? Find a cause you're passionate about and become its towering spokesperson.  The cool thing is, all these ideas - modeling, acting, fashion, content creation, public speaking - they're all connected. You could mix and match to create your own unique business. Maybe team up with some friends or partner with folks already in these fields to get started.  Whatever you decide to do, keep us in the loop! We'd love to support you on your journey.   Wishing you all the best, big guy! 🙏🏿🙏🏿"

Ask yourself what was the economic reason for discontinuing the 2 cedis note that had Nkrumah’s image on it. That cedi bill is mysteriously lost from the system; they only maintained its coin version.   This move by Akufo-Addo climaxes his ulterior motive for becoming president. It was more about him and maintaining his name and clans name and giving it a special place in the history books of Ghana, subtly, than it was about the nation. Every old gee/senior citizen who lived and saw his father warned the nation against this man.   I’m from Takoradi, and it suddens me that this man’s statue stands somewhere in the city with Paa Grant. If I had the opportunity, I’d relinquish my Ghanaian citizenship because of him and this move of his, especially. How can anyone be this evil and mediocre and crown himself?

If there is a (stable)West African capable of entering the Aerospace sector Ghana is well positioned to try.  Entering the Aerospace arena, might serve as a financial engineering “hat trick”.  Contrary to common belief, sometimes it takes disruptive creative technologies and visions to inspire.  As someone who’s invested in Ghana and Nigeria, keeping it 💯 placing probability of near term success on Ghana. Some may possess a different opinion, but the fact Ghana comprehends the critical importance of international recognition, respect and confidence to attempt a bold goal, is inspiring.  Ghana is a beautiful country with beautiful and talented people.  Make no mistake there are challenges but there are many in diaspora whom see the amazing potential in Ghana.  Some key takeaways in Ghana:  Internet Gateway for West Africa Safety is priority / relatively stable electricity compared to a large neighbor 👀😎 Despite smaller population, overall net achievements in “stable” business operations without too much tribal / religious tensions ( I’m an atheist 😁) makes more comfortable for operating small firm.  Hope Ghana embarks on its mission to enter space, this will pave the way forward for more international investors, small investors can enter the space, and ultimately will create a broader spectrum of diverse jobs.  Aerospace engineering is crucial to driving GDP. It will force more firms to grow, startups to take root , and implement a strong business cycle from transport, critical testing, manufacturing, telecommunications, high technology applied science firms.  In fact thank you for this post as it confirms that there is interest. Instead of Doubting Ghana, find ways to see where and how you can get involved.  The energy and brilliance of Ghanaian students is nothing short of amazing.  Ghana gains all the praise, because Ghana attempts what most west African countries would not.  You don’t aim for things because they are easy, but attempt those that are hard, no one said it would be easy, but the fabric of Ghanaian People just cut different.  Every Ghanian I’ve met displayed an interest in 1 area, but possessed skills in like 2 or 3 other areas, and could easily run circles around others.  If you are in Ghana, make no mistake there are foreign nationals whom are very interested in your country, Ghana considering stronger Aerospace programs can uplift many of the other areas requiring attention.  Ghana ultimately will develop a space program, question is will you be on the sidelines doubting or get involved to find out where and how your talents can enable stronger Aerospace capabilities in Ghana.   Not even from Ghana but from my travels, Ghana deserves the opportunity to forge a aerospace program as it’s likely going to lead West Africa and become a gateway to Aerospace technology for West Africa"

There are a variety of Aerospace firms looking to gain new customers, partners and infrastructure bases Ghana could benefit from.

Most of these people are useless gossips, whatever turn you take in life, they will gossip about it. Forget them.  I actually find people marrying and giving birth in this useless insecure world delusional, but I do not move about projecting my thinking and feelings onto people. Why would anyone lacking in so many ways want to selfishly give birth and let their kids ensure the insecurities of this life. Even if someone has in abundance it is their sole prerogative to decide to keep a partner or have offsprings. Our society will never outgrow this very archaic mentality. Just don't keep company in order not to listen to their nonsense."

And while I understand humans needing human contact whatsoever, I think it’s pretty important to think critically about decisions surrounding serious relationships that are legally binding (i.e marriage). I am still yet to meet one soul, just ONE who’s married, and happy.   Every individual I’ve met seems miserable. From Africans, to Hispanics to Americans, Asians, you name it. I don’t even ask them about their marriage, they just begin to vent cause there’s no other safe space. It sounds pretty suffocating imo. If you approach marriage as a transaction cause that’s all it is anyway, and if you’re lucky, your partner might “ love” you. And that love is conditional.   And don’t even get me started on the finances spent on big weddings. There’s 0 need for it. You’re telling me,,!?? that you find someone who loves you for who you are, cares for you blah blah blah but need some event and jewelry to prove their love for you is real? SCAM! And just to live the next decades working hand to mouth/ barely making ends meet and bringing kids in to one-day be their gateway to financial freedom. Bunch of BS imo."

I am a non-Ghanaian who has been to Ghana and has some very close Ghanaian friends. One of those friends has told me that people in Ghana are willing to go and fight in Ukraine. I have always dismissed this. But this is proof that at least one person from Ghana was willing to travel thousands of miles to fight in a war that has nothing to do with them and that has horrendous casualty rates, especially on the Russian side. It has left me wondering if there is widespread support for Putin and his war in Ukraine? And if so, do some people really believe fighting in that war is the best way to improve their way in life, especially given the reputation of the Russian army?"

Not research here, but my own memory: Some of us were reading of the events real-time, as they were happening way back in 2014, so it's disheartening to see how people would try to ram a different truth down our ears. I remember how some people pretended to be Russian snipers and shot others at a sponsored rally. I remember the American ambassador taking cookies to encourage the people who staged a coup against the original Ukrainian government. I remember her leaked phone call where she said ""f**k the EU"". Now they would spin it as ""propaganda"", ""fake news"", ""conspiracy theory"", and try to give us a different version of history. Question is, what is NATO doing miltarizing at Russia's border after signing pacts against that? That is the cause of this conflict, but it's masked behind ""sovereign country"" and ""democracy"" and demonizing ""communist Putin""."

In 2014 Putin anexed crimea which is 96% russian. After taking it there was litlle to no resistence from Ukraine cuz most of the people honestly wanted for the peninsula to go back to russia. The area was underdeveloped and a lot of money poured in after the anexation improving lifes of its people (a lot of russian speaking regions of ukraine were intentionally kept poor).  Ukraine had discriminated its russian speaking population for a long time. Imagine ur russian speaking ukrainian you and your city mostly speak russian but the government start banning your language in cinemas, schools and other public spaces. Its like Akan people would now start banning ewe or ga language just because they are in minority and wanted akan to be the main one. Of course it doesnt justify the invasion but president zelensky before elbeing elected said he will take back crimea (how if not by war? Pretty warmongering) Plus Nato and Eu wanted to grab it for itself and start settling their military equipment there which well, would be really close to Russia and was against the agreements from 1990. Russia is the bad one true, but it all isnt black and white as people think. The war was avoidable and weak Usa especially pathetic withdraw from afghanistan and aggresive ukrainian rhetoric made putin think he can and should grab ukraine for himself."

Im neither ukraine nor russian so I dont spread any misinformation and since I live in the west its in my interest for russia to lose. What I said is true antirussian sentiment in eastern ukraine was real. Check on youtube how crimea penninsula was governed and how it thrived after russian annexation. Ukraine as a country was created after USSR collapse and many things like borders were written on the map in chaos and a lot of different factors caused crimea to be within ukrainian territory. The people there are russian 96% speak russia and since annexation there are no uprisings whatsoever, compare to ""mainland"" ukraine and see the difference in resistance. Additionaly there are statues of fascist Bandera and he is praised by many ukrainians (I still dont understand how this wasnt banned by ukrainian government, its like there was a statue of adolf hitler in berlin). While in eastern ukraine I could see a lot of banderas flags that caused a lot of mixed feelings in me.

You seem a good fellow because you ask questions. That's a good mind...so l will indulge a bit.  Have you asked yourself why Cuba is professed enemy of the US? I am sure you know of the Monroe Doctrine.   Ukraine did not start today...it has being long in the making. A poster here has explained US actions in the Maidan events of 2014. I won't repeat that.  However l will remind you of the Cuban Missile crisis of 1963 when the world nearly came to nuclear war. The whole world read the aggressors, the USSR, was putting weapons in Cuba.  The little reported fact  was  the US had placed similar weapons in Turkey and the Soviet Union had reacted.  Ukraine is inviting Nato to place weapons and troops there and you think Putin should simply look on.   Don't forget Cuba is enemy of US because she is friend of Russia.  Now, l hope, the Arab saying makes sense....to you."

In fact, your Cuban missile crisis example is bizarre, because Ukraine was a part of the USSR, hell they manufactured a lot of the weapons.  This is a case of Russia backstabbing their own and Ukraine had no choice, but to turn to the West for help.  Look at the politics of Kazakhstan recently, they had no problems with Russia. Putin got too full of himself, he is making Russia impossible to work with.  Look at Armenia, they needed protection, they were aligned with Russia. Russia screwed them over."

My Cuban missile example is to show how superpowers guard their backyard. Did you read on principles of the Monroe Doctrine? Ukraine allowing NATO to setup camp across the border was a provocation encouraged by the US. That was challenge of Russian power. You say Ukraine was part of the USSR...hell, no why they should not be joining military alliance of the West then. Who back stabbed whom in this case? Strange you twisting facts to fit your narrative.   Ukraine had every choice...even to simply join EU without NATO. It choose to endanger Russian security. Russia had proposed security guarantee if she stayed neutral.   I am not following you in rambling discourse on Kazakstan, Armenia etc etc. I value my time."

About investment, you should consider a barbershop, provision shop, or something of that sort in a good location, get a humble, responsible and passionate persons to take charge and account to you.   After that, you can consider getting a car for rides like bolt and yango.  And then think about expansion of these businesses.   You don't have to start with something that makes you a million in a month, start small and expand along the way. If you have something dependable in times of crisis, you can then think about huge investments  I hope you find this helpful ✌🥂"

On paper it sounds a lot but realistically, it’s just enough to get by, worse when you have a family. But if you’re young, just starting off, I’d say you’re in your prime for savings. Key word is diversify. If you would use half for your personal expenses, and don’t be quick to say I’m not a big spender, because believe or not, your tastes would change. So make sure you take out the percentage you need for savings  asap. Better, get a standing order from your bank to make the deposits even before it hits your account. You can drop a major percentage into 2 fixed deposit accounts (edc and mfund used to be the reliable ones but now you can’t even tell for Ghana). Use another for a health insurance or plan, and if there’s still enough, buy some amount of dollars and stack them somewhere. These are just my 2 cents. I tried and it helped until I got my haircuts. But at least the money is still there until hopefully the economy clears. Good luck to you. And I wish you upward trajectory only in your earnings. ✌🏿"

Step #1 would be to save at least your first 20% in a savings account with that much of an increase. Your return will be low in the savings account but don't go rushing into investing until you understand it. Also increase your retirement if you have that option.

First of all, when it comes to business, there's nothing like ""many people are selling the same thing"", though it is considerable, the most important thing is what makes your service or product different from those competitors.        ... You can use the Nigerian phone accessory sellers in Ghana for example; there could be tens of them at the same spot including Ghanaian sellers and the Nigerians will be getting more customers and sales whiles the Ghanaian sellers complain... it's simply about uniqueness in method of service, good customer service and strategies 🤷‍♂️  Farming as you said is a good investment but consider all that goes into farming... you can't just stand up and say you're doing farming. In that cycle, you need to invest in good irrigation system, storage, transportation, storage after transporting to the markets, and a whole lot but in my case, we're looking at something that can sustain you and the family, even if you later decide to invest your last into agriculture ( farming ).  Sure we need food everyday, but that doesn't mean people don't buy bread, gari, toothpaste, water, etc from the provision shops everyday It doesn't mean people especially students and workers don't trim their hairs everyday too."

You’re staring at two houses, one in Ghana, one in Arlington, Texas. Both could be yours. But only one of them actually should be. And spoiler alert: it’s not the one in Ghana.  $132,000.   That’s what they want for a 3-bedroom house in Ghana. Let that sink in for a moment. In a country where the average monthly wage hovers around $100-$200, someone thinks this makes sense. It doesn’t.  Meanwhile, in Arlington, yes, that Arlington, the one nestled in the heart of the DFW metroplex, where the Cowboys play and where families actually want to live, rent or purchase starter homes, you can find comparable properties. Properties that sit in good school districts. Properties that appreciate. Properties that make sense.  Here’s the thing about real estate: it’s not just about the building. It’s about the ecosystem. And Arlington’s ecosystem is thriving. Families chasing the American dream. Young professionals who want space but can’t stomach Austin’s prices. They’re all there, making the DFW market hum with activity.  And you, dear foreign investor, can be part of this. All you need is a TIN number. That’s it. No American citizenship required. No permanent residency needed. Just a simple tax ID number that lets you play in one of the most stable real estate markets in the world.  But what about Ghana? Well, what about it? Sure, there’s growth. Sure, there’s potential. But $132,000? In a market where property rights can be as clear as mud? Where infrastructure is more ""maybe"" than ""definitely""? Where the power grid plays hide and seek with reliability?   It’s a sunny Tuesday morning in Accra. You’re feeling good about your $132,000 investment in that three-bedroom house. The papers are signed. The money’s transferred. You’re officially a homeowner in Ghana.  Except maybe you’re not.  Here’s the dirty little secret about real estate in Ghana that nobody wants to talk about: your ownership is only as secure as the integrity of the person processing papers at the Lands Commission. And integrity, as it turns out, can have a surprisingly affordable price tag.  One envelope. One carefully placed bribe. One strategic conversation. That’s all it takes for your name to disappear from a land title and someone else’s to magically appear. Poof. Like a magic trick, except the only thing disappearing is your investment.  The math just doesn’t work.  In Arlington, your investment comes with America’s legal system. With proper title insurance. With property management companies that actually answer their phones. With tenants who pay in dollars, you know, the currency that actually matters in global markets.  But perhaps most importantly, it comes with optionality. Want to sell? There’s a market for that. Want to leverage your equity for another property? There’s a banking system for that. Want to use it as a stepping stone to bigger investments in the US? There’s a path for that.  The Ghana house? It’s just a house. A very expensive house in a market that doesn’t justify its price tag.  Look, I get it. Investing in your home country feels good. It feels right. But this isn’t about feelings. This is about cents and sensibility. And at $132,000, this Ghana property is neither sensible nor likely to make you many cents.  The choice is yours. But really, it isn’t. Because there’s only one choice that makes sense here.  And it’s in Arlington.   P.S. The Cowboys still aren’t going to win the Super Bowl this year. But at least your investment will be winning.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​    https://www.redfin.com/TX/Arlington/1122-Millview-Dr-76012/unit-2204/home/169577903"

I honestly think there’s a lot of over priced real estate in Accra.  Outside of some major cities in Nigeria it seems like West African major cities have really overpriced real estate when you compare it to other countries in africa and around the world.

What is the association dues? If it's in dollars, I'd say be very careful.  2. How open are they about financial stuff? i.e. does the association truly have control of the money.  3. How much yard space do you have? Doesn't look like a lot.  4. What is the 132K giving you. i.e. how are the roads to and from the house. How are the gutters  5. Can you afford to rent it out at a loss if need be. i.e. do you realistically think someone is going to pay 1.5K a month? Probably not   All said, I personally think new builds are over priced. If you can get them to knock it down to 110K or less, you'd be golden.   Good luck"

Let me tell you Accra is a developing city it is not fully developed. Paying developed city prices is ridiculous.  Also they are not supposed to be selling it to you in dollars from my understanding it is illegal.  EDIT: If you guys want a more organized city Kumasi is the place to check out. Called the Garden City with lush forestry and tree canopy with a beautiful lake. It is also much cleaner than Accra. The King of the Ashanti region is highly intelligent and is very involved in the development of Kumasi and the Ashanti Region as a whole

This post suggests you can find a 3-bedroom house in Arlington for $132,000. As someone living in Arlington, I can tell you that’s highly unrealistic. Even the linked “house” in his response isn’t a house, it’s a condo/townhouse, not a standalone, and judging by how long it’s been at the market, ~50 days, for that price? Anyone who lives in America knows that there is something wrong with it. Any house you could find at that price is likely to be in such poor condition that the cost of necessary repairs would far exceed the initial investment. We’re talking about homes with severe structural issues, outdated systems, or even health hazards like mold. The idea of finding a well-maintained, move-in ready 3-bedroom house at that price is a lie, it does not exist in Texas, you could go to the most country, middle of nowhere area and still not find a nice home for 132k. You could find a niceish studio apartment for that price if you are interested though.  Even if you manage to find a decently priced home, you can’t ignore the high property taxes in Texas. Arlington’s property tax rate is substantial, and combined with other taxes like HOA fees, local/city taxes, monthly expenses, Ghana vs US home will shock a non Americans. “Well the roads are finished” the amount of taxes we pay here you would think we were paying for self driving roads, talk to any American who pays taxes and they will complain about the amount the pay vs the quality of road we actually have.  The notion of “owning” a home free and clear is misleading in America, failing to pay taxes will result in losing your property.  Utilities in Arlington can also be quite expensive. During the hot Texas summers, air conditioning costs can skyrocket, and winter heating bills aren’t exactly cheap either. These ongoing costs can significantly impact your monthly budget.  The rental market in Arlington isn’t as robust as the post suggests. Renting a house long-term is less common because rental prices for homes are often comparable to or even higher than mortgage payments. Many people opt for apartments or condos, which offer better amenities and are often more affordable. This means you will have a hard time finding a renter.  Investing in American real estate isn’t without its pitfalls. Market fluctuations, maintenance costs, and the risk of bad tenants are all real concerns. Additionally, the process of buying property as a foreign investor, while technically possible with a TIN, comes with its own set of bureaucratic hurdles and potential legal complications.  The fact of the matter is the real estate market here isn’t as rosy as painted in the post. Finding a bargain 3-bedroom house that’s in GOOD CONDITION is impossible, if you want to pay 130 for a house expect to pay at minimum 100k for repairs. The high costs associated with taxes and utilities can make “owning” a home quite difficult exercise when people decide to stop renting your home. Investing in real estate anywhere comes with risks, and it’s crucial to be aware of the downsides before making a decision.   To be clear, that north legon house is too expensive, find one right outside of legon, airport region, all those overpriced areas, for ~60k and you will have a real winner because those are the types of places that are next up for inflation, 10 years you’ll have a 100k+ house on your hand, try the same in America and if you fail to find consistent renters, you’ll have a 100k debt and no house😭 Only good point made here was the possibility of someone trying to take the property, most of the time this can be resolved in court, but to be fair sometimes it isn’t. But don’t make it sound like America is made of gold because it isn’t 💀"

North Legon is one of the elite neighborhoods in Accra.   And until the Ghana buyer decides to vehemently reject such prices that is how much you’ll pay.   With your analysis of the Ghanaian economy and all that, honestly the economy on record is totally different from what Ghanaians like with. Ghanaians are miraculously creatures; we always seem to find money from God knows where.   My advise, if you need to get a property in Ghana and you can afford, I think you should go with your technical advisor to access the property and get it. Other than that you don’t need it. Just know that over here that’s how things work, though distasteful but that’s our reality."

Have you heard of foreclosures? Tax sales? Estate sales? Your whole ""it must be broken if it’s cheap"" argument completely ignores the distressed property market. A market that’s absolutely thriving for investors who know where to look.  No, $132,000 won’t buy you a mansion in Arlington. It won’t even buy you a perfect move-in ready house. But it will buy you opportunity.  That’s the point you’re missing.  Smart investors aren’t hunting for their forever home. They’re hunting for properties they can turn around. Properties with problems they can fix. Properties that people like you are too scared to touch.  Speaking of fear, let’s talk about property disclosures and inspections. You know, those legally required documents and processes that protect buyers in the US? Tell me where to find those in Ghana. I’ll wait.  (Fun fact: Just yesterday I was at a friend’s house in East Legon. Their kitchen range hood wasn’t even connected to a vent. Try getting that past a Texas home inspector.)  You’re complaining about property taxes? That’s called having skin in the game. It’s what keeps your property values stable. It’s what funds those schools that keep families flooding into DFW. Show me that kind of stability in Ghana.  Let’s address your utility bill panic. Yes, Texas summers are hot. Yes, AC costs money. But Texas also has some of the most reasonable electricity rates in the US, thanks to our booming solar energy sector. Want proof? Check ERCOT’s live rates. Better yet, try pricing out a full solar solution with tax breaks in Ghana. Spoiler alert: You can’t.  The rental market ""isn’t robust""? Tell that to the thousands of people moving to DFW monthly. Tell that to the companies relocating their headquarters here. Tell that to the landlords who can’t keep up with demand.  Real estate investing isn’t about buying perfect properties. It’s about buying problems you can solve.  That $132,000 property might need work. It might need a lot of work. But in a market where median home prices are pushing $300,000, that’s not a bug. It’s a feature.  And your Ghana alternative? Sure, you might find something for $60,000 outside Legon. You might even see it appreciate. But you know what you won’t find? Real legal protections. Actual property rights. The ability to leverage your investment for future growth.  The choice isn’t between a perfect Arlington house and a perfect Ghana house. It’s between a fixable problem in a stable market and a ""good deal"" in a system where property rights depend on who has the biggest white or brown envelope."

When I look at the family I know here in Ghana, they are all very focussed on being entrepreneurs with their own businesses. They seem to be waaay better off than this average salary. In that regard, now it makes more sense to me that they would all be more focussed on starting their own businesses. Because especially when you deal with international clients or import and export of certain goods, you are more likely to make a good living than working as an employee for a regular salary.   At the same time, this creates a massive wealth disparity.  Imagine a lawyer charging US/European clients 150 USD or more an hour for their work and compare that to regular wages."

I ask and assume this, as I'm a women (similar age like you are) and live and grew up in Switzerland and I'm also from Ghana. I've been to the US (big citys and small places) and I've also been in Ghana (big citys and small places). When I compare the 3 diffrent locations I come to the result, that I feel not safe in Ghana, I've seen, expirienced and heard already so much violence, thefts and corruption there. Where as Switzerland is the safest of all 3 but also here you have racism, it is mostly a subtile one. What I liked in the US is that there are more BIPoC, where here in Switzerland I feel mostly alone as most of the ppl are white incl. my closest friends and family. I'm also thinking of moving but I don't know where I like to go. What I like to ask with all that, is how does it come that you feel safe in Ghana?"

However, you’ll soon understand that the vast majority of Ghanaians are not doing very well economically. The government is hopelessly corrupt, too - the elite in Accra are seriously out of touch with how most people live. You’ll note that rich people live in heavily secured houses, with guards, high walls and often razor wire. I’d be surprised if you don’t. I lived in Accra for 5 years. Yes there are great things about Accra - but don’t over romanticize it, friend. I found that people who do are generally simply the rich. Living in a poor part of Accra is abject misery."

What I can attest to is that Ghana provides a much safer and free life than I had in America,  most people look like me when I go out and when I deal with the police it’s not a threat of me losing my life for a simple violation as is in the states.  So as I’m about on daily basis I can walk the streets anytime of the day or night without any threat or such things,  where as in America being black could get you killed for simply minding  your own business.  I thank god I haven’t seen anything to say it’s more crime here and I feel it will continue to be that way the locals are very chilled people and in public if something is not right trust the mob will come.  Again for me coming to Ghana I am at peace and fell very safe here!!  I highly encourage you to come visit and I’ll show you what Ghana has to offer so you can see and feel the love."

Whereas in the states we pay on a monthly term which can help balance your pockets a little better.  I must say in Accra you can find places to rent that are affordable but they may be further out from the main areas. Then there are places that are a bit expensive for rent to be in dollars and a year up front."

Properties are well into 400k usd which is hard to justify when it’s on a dirt road and the seller only wants cash no payment plan I’m here because I see the future but some people are charging outrageous prices for things.  On the other hand some things are well to manage and affordable but to think you can come here and live for years with little save it’s not possible.

I can just tell from my perspective, which might be very different to someone who moved here later in his life. Some background information: I grew up in Switzerland with just a swiss mother (= just the swiss culture) and talk swiss german, I feel mostly swiss (am trying now to learn about my other roots).       Things which disturb me are:    \- when ppl talk to me in high german and don't swich to our mother tongue after hearing me.   \- when you are in groups and ppl don't hear you.   \- when you have to follow the rules in a more strict way, as you will get faster a fee or a negative feedback then others who look swiss.    \- being told that I'm to direct (the man can say the same thing or worse and it is no problem).   \- ppl don't take me as serious and qualified as i am.   \- being watched while shopping.   \- not being asked for political signatures, while passing them.   \- if you do things like bring a cake or do extra work it is ""normal"" and not many recognize it but if you don't do it or say ""no"" to some things, you get looked at in a strange way or they want to change your decision.    \- some black man who don't know much about swiss mentality, look and sometimes talk to me like I'm ""candy"", where as some older (50+ age) swiss man, think I'm an ""exotic"" play toy. Which makes some networking quite annoying and destroys any interesting business relationship which I wanted to build with them. And all of this, while I'm married, which they see and know.   \- I live in a nice neighborhood, with mostly single family houses. Once my brother came visiting me and my neighbor form like 3 houses away called the police, because she thought he is a burglar. He even told her, that he is visiting me, as she asked him, what he is doing here. The police was feeling uncomfortable, maybe even a little ashamed when we talked with them. They apologized for the disturbance and left.  As adult I mostly have subtle discrimination experience, which is based on multiple discrimination, build on being a ""young, good looking"" black women.    I know others, who mistrust the police or always take the purchase receipt as they are scared of being controlled with bad intentions. And I have heard of children who are now a days still bullied at school because of their skin color. So there is still existing worse than what I've experienced but what I don't like is the feeling that ppl treat me as foreigner in my own home country.  Things I'm happy for:   \- No problem with finding an apartment or a good job   \- Always good - very good salary   \- Never problems with the police and they always helped me when I needed them   \- Never problems with a governmental office concerning taxes or unemployment help   \- Never problems with insurances   \- Feeling always safe, no matter where I am and what time it is   \- Having a medical system, which allows me to go to good doctors, which I've chosen  What makes a difference is if you live in the city or the village but also in the city (where I life mostly) you have those problems. I guess in Zürich (german spaeking) you'll have less such problems, as it is more multicultural and what I've heard from a very high and specialized doctor, that you are confronted with it every where but at least in Geneva (french speaking).  I hope I have helped you a little. If you have more questions I'm happy to answer them."

What you don't know is that Ghanaians are generally not encouraged by society to tell their true feelings or open up easily. Ask every Ghanaian you meet a simple 'how are you?' and they will say 'I am well by God's grace' without blinking an eye.    Deep within, they are anxious, depressed, praying earnestly for Jesus to come, crying at night..   However, in the morning, they are out and about like nothing is wrong :-). There are stories of suicide you will never hear about until it happens to someone close to you.    But truly, the majority of us are able to anchor our faith in God daily and somehow keep moving regardless. "

I've found that apot of Blacks who come from Western countries go to Africa & try to do the exact same thing they have been doing  in those Western countries..... Going to Africa, isolating themselves, looking for jobs, & basically chasing the Amerikkkan or European dream, trying to have the white picket fence.  If you go to Africa looking to continue your Western lifestyle, then you will be paying the same Western money you were already paying in the West.   Africa does not work that way. The Caribbean doesn't either, & both of them work very similar (for those of us from the Caribbean).  You won't survive with a more African-minded mentality.   For instance, you don't go to Africa looking for a job. You go to Africa looking CREATE jobs. The jobs that exist in Africa should be given to the locals as first priority."

A broken constitution that, even if invoked, can be stalled by the ""supreme"" court.  If you didn’t know, let me clue you in. The law serves the ordinary citizen. However, the elites—politicians, expatriates, and the like—have heavily invested in families that produce lawyers (loophole experts) to exploit legal nuances whenever they find themselves at fault.  Today, law as a discipline and profession is being gatekept. If you don’t belong to one of these families or are not backed by someone influential, it becomes an uphill battle."

Some shoppers drop 100 cedi and expect to be treated like King Charles. I studied Chinese millionaires and billionaires well over a decade ago. I found their business model quite interesting. They had over a billion people back then. The average storekeeper knew he could become a millionaire one penny at a time. Quality meant next to nothing and customer service meant even less. Their model was based on offering the lowest price and collecting pennies.   **What do Ghanaian merchants do to foreign shoppers?** They try to rob us at every opportunity.

Do not believe your father that cheating is inherent in all men.   It is just the excuse of cowards who are too afraid to tell the truth to those around them. If they truly see nothing wrong with dating more than one woman, they would openly tell both women that they are doing so. But they can’t.   These are same cowardly men who are incensed if their wife or side chick also sleeps with other men. Again if there was nothing wrong with it, why don’t they want it done to them.   Ghanaian culture which encourages this sort of nonsense needs to die out. There is nothing wrong with having multiple wives/partners if the women agree. That is what used to happen in the past. Before Christian marriage came into the picture women also had more freedom to entertain multiple men, as long as they attributed parentage of their children to the right man and the man took care of them.   Being the stirrer that I am, I would have looked your father in the eye and told him you are happy he doesn’t hold fidelity or loyalty  in marriage as important because you know some seriously wealthy uncle who likes your mum. Now you can peacefully encourage your mum to receive that uncle so you can also benefit without your father causing problems.   Let’s see if he will take that lightly."

But it doesn't describe the men you're talking about anyway. Because one key component of this compulsion that they have is that all of their women have to be faithful.  Entire cultures can become disordered just like the personality of an individual. In many cultures, men treat women like objects or servants. They want variety. Bored with one, play with another one. That is how you treat a toy. That is not intimacy, it is more similar to scrolling a porn site. The necessity for deceitful relationships is that they also want a servant to cook and clean.  They are little boys with the fantasy that they are kings. Not all men are like this. I'm sure not even all Ghanaian men are like this, but yes some cultures can come to be very unhealthy. It won't change as long as Ghanaian women keep marrying these men and accepting this behavior."

I was tempted to say all men, but I know that's the 1st thing someone would disagree with me about.🙄  So sure, Not all men cheat, BUT most of them do and will.   Personally, I Still don't see why women want to still marry men and have kids with them. Men are incredibly selfish. And most times the woman ends up doing Most of the work to raise the kids anyway. Men also don't care about a women's feelings because they themselves are Emotionally Unavailable.   Men look at women like tools, something to be put to use. If you serve no use to them, then they will leave.   Some women tolerate men cheating on them if the man has alot of money and can provide financial security for her and the kids. Some women don't mind being the 2nd or 3rd wife. I'm just not that kind of woman.   I just think men should just be upfront about the type of relationship they want to have. If they can't be monogamous or don't have the desire to, then they should BE HONEST and Upfront about it. And then let the woman decide for herself if she wants to stay in a polygamous relationship or not."

Due to acculturation people will vary on their willingness to engage in polyamorous behavior.  I would say our culture suffers from a lack of rules and regulations in so many areas - and this ‘cheating’ epidemic or normalcy is a just another manifestation of our lack of social order.   That said you can find a man who won’t cheat but with all things when it comes to relationships - it is a difficult search finding the proper partner. I wish you luck!

I'm glad to see everyone passionate about what they believe in and their view of the world.   Here's my view.  Monogamy, Polygamy, Polyamory and all that - they are all just conceptual ways of organizing human relationships. Humans are great at buying into such concepts and then convincing themselves ""this is the only/best way to live"". Because of our conservative biases (we all have this bias, regardless of our politics), it is very hard for us to imagine that a different way of being may also be acceptable, or even good. These concepts also have strong effects on our feelings and thoughts around fairness and justice.  In some societies, monogamy is deeply entrenched into the very fabric of life and reinforced by cultural practices and religion. At least, on the surface. Some other societies embrace other relationship forms. Ghana seems to be in a transitional phase from a historically polygamous to a monogamous one with roots in Victorian culture and values. Will that transition ever complete? Who knows.   Newsflash for some people here: Cheating is globally rampant and absolutely not a ""Ghanaian thing"". Look up Ashley Madison.  As for me, I'm married. I never planned on being a cheater. Early on, I was proud to have signed away my bachelor days and on being a good husband. 3 years in, I have 3 side chicks. I don't feel bad about it and don't do it to hurt anybody. I have needs that my wife alone will never be able to satisfy. Trying to get those needs met by her would be an endless nagging exercise on my part. I still consider myself a very good husband, by the way. And I plan to keep it that way. So help me God 🙃🙏."

Men are genetically geared for polygamy. I don't know why people complain when it's always been a thing since the dawn of humanity.  Says it's 10000 people in a village 5000 being men and the other 5000 being women and a war happens. 2500 men die in that war, where does that leave 2500 women? Without a man. So they either be alone and have to fight the dangers of the world and society alone or they take on a man who has another woman for protection, companionship, family, etc. That was the reality of life historically as humans.  People are in a box and don't think our biological makeup and history doesn't play a major factor in our behavior when it's DNA that ultimately controls our entire makeup.  The only men who can stay with one woman is men who lacks options , or he so in love with the one he has that he must be monogamous because he can't see himself without her or he just simply want her only which is rare without first having experiences with a few women prior.  About 80%+ of women. From my experience just don't have the IT factor, although all the women I have dated are great women .That in love tingling feeling you get in yo chest. It's spiritual and a soul connection .and sometimes it takes time for it to come if it isn't immediate. Most of the time it doesn't come at all or you will have made mistakes that leads to the end of the relationship before it has a chance to manifest itself.  Women , in all genuineness and  honesty, true love is hard to find and most people have to create the love they yearn for through work and sacrifice. Most people go through many rough patches and time periods in their relationships and the only thing that keeps them together is patience, love, and the desire to make things work. Most of the time men have to grow to love you as a women and be the man you want because 9/10 you want him more than he wants you and you're just the best thing for him at the time when you shoulda chose the man who wants you more than you want him but that's another topic."

Europeans literally took African history, compiled the stories, edited the stories, and used them to help change culture and even justify chattel slavery which is the worse kind of slavery ever. They even tried to steal your golden stool.  What Africans were doing before Europeans came was OUR thing. Many wives actually helped build communities and everyone had a job and usefulness.

I mean look at the logistics of it. Women across cultures have been more likely to agree with polygamy vs men agreeing to polyamory. If women could reliably find men who'd share them with other men it would likely work but doesn't for the same reason women won't propose to a man for marriage.

That's a few too many museums for my taste ... 😁  If you are young and fit, there are hiking trails and bike rides, beaches and horse back riding and surfing.   Kakum is amazing- wear good walking sandals.   If you don't have time to make it to Ada and Keta ( astonishing beaches! ) then go to Akosombo for the Volta River and amazing river trips.  Nights out: I love Bella Afrik, Living Room  and  Li Beirut in East Legon, Fridays (it's a restaurant) in Sakumono All good food, live music and fun.   Lunch/brunch: Kukun and Labone Coffee Shop and Starbites  Excellent and authentic food - Try upstairs at Champion Dishes (not at all fancy, but delicious!) and the food at Fridays is great for Sunday lunch.   The Good Baker and La Gallette- excellent patisseries and there is excellent ice-cream in Osu."

The Independence Square and Black Star Gate are just photo ops, as far as I can tell."

I first visited over a decade ago and now I spend more time here than in the US where I am from.  I’m not sure where you will be visiting from, if you have friends/relatives/hosts here already, what your interests are, or what kind of activity level you are looking for. That will have a lot it do with the itinerary.  Other than I’d choose AfroTours Ghana for my guide, you have a great list. Having a guide you can trust and reliable transportation is key. Do you know where you are staying? Let me know if you need recommendations. There are good options from 5 star to more modest authentic options that are safe and clean.   You are a bit heavy on things that are western flavored (for example SkyBar has a wonderful view and is nice, but it’s western food. You won’t learn a lot of Ghana there. So only go to relax at night, not to get deep culture).   I would add cultural heritage sites like the last bath site at the Assin Manso slave market over some of the museums. You could do a trip to Kumasi as some have recommended, but it’s a bit of a drive for your 8 day trip. If you really want it I’d consider taking a quick cheap flight.   Azmera is a wonderful local food restaurant. While at the Dubois Centre I’d suggest eating at the restaurant there called Roots. They have the best red red. There are a few other food choices I’d swap out for a more local flavor. For example Id swap Breakfast to Breakfast for going to Peduase Valley Resort, especially for Sunday brunch. That is a much better experience.   Enjoy your trip. Let me know if you have any questions or need any tips. I hope you enjoy Ghana as much as I do."

Feel free to blame the USA for the intergenerational slavery that followed. Just remember that the law which made is possible was from a ruling a black Angolan won against a white Virginian who wanted to hire away his black Cameroonian indentured servant.  I get frustrated when Black Americans and Ghanaians alike assume America should pay to refurbish or upkeep the slave castles built by the European colonizers and slave traders.

When the slave Masters sought out to recapture most of the slaves, the indigenous of the land, lead them down to Mexico to escape. When the Mexican president was confronted by, the British colonist to retrieve our ancestors, the Mexican president said “ we don’t believe in slavery down here, we are all human beings. If you want them, you can come and try and get them.” And that was said as a warning. The British colonists were already wary of dealing with large numbers of our people fighting back, but for Mexico they were willing to go to war for us and we even integrated with their culture.

For the Jollof part, rice wasn't a staple in our parts until Asian Rice arrived. African rice has low yield and I'm not even sure I've seen any cook jollof with that before (of course I'm sure someone has but I mean in the traditional sense).

Specifically Argentina. They have photographs when europeans travel down there and majority of the population in Argentina was of dark Melanated skin, or had some sort of African indigenous descent. As for the indigenous tribes here that have on record that Africans had lived here long before Europeans came, you must do research about the government in the early 1900s doing extensive work to give money to tribes in America in exchange to denounce the Africans of indigenous descent. Specifically an article around a woman back in the I believe around 1970s where she was undoubtedly a Choctaw native, but the government gave indigenous reparations to all of the native tribes that agreed to denounce their African bloodline or connection. The lady was very distraught and realize that when the federal government gave the tribe, she was part of in Oklahoma over $24 million, she didn’t receive a penny of it and went to the new crews about it only for it to be shelved in news history."

I simple pointed out that the existence of African rice predates the introduction of Asian varieties in response to OP stating that rice wasnt native to West Africa until recently.  In any case that claim would depend on where/which people you're talking about but African rice was very much a staple food for many West African ethnic groups for thousands of years. Some may have prioritised millet and sorghum but certainly not everyone. It was enough of a staple food that the people enslaved from the 'rice coast' were sought after for their expertise in rice cultivation.

Hungry as he was, he tasted and ate the ripe fruits.   He brought home a bunch of the green ones and a bunch of the ripe ones and showed them to his fellow hunters and wife.   He went for more another time, which were boiled in water and prepared as Ampesi, as we do with Yam, hence the name “Obeboa- Ode” i.e. coming to assist Yam, now corrupted into Oborode.

These crops did not originate from West Africa. West Africa especially was significantly isolated from the world when the Sahara desert formed and so a lot of our crops came from when the Portuguese started trading with us. And it's more interesting when you realize that a lot of our festivals are tied to these new crops. Such as Homowo and maize (they probably had those festivities because they were amazed at it's high yield). I believe you can start googling the history of these crops and you'd see that a lot of our local cuisines are filled with crops that arrived less than a 1000 years ago.  https://preview.redd.it/re1dtubgy6zc1.png?width=1079&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cc69005e12515f5d52b3151a7da6e2644075196d

The Asantes fought the Fantes and won as you rightly said under Bonsu (his name literally translating as ""touched water"") but not taking control of them. The Fantes signed on to be part of the British protectorate and the Asantes had no problem with them as they weren't under them. The Asantes were mostly bothered with access to the foreigners which the Fantes kept for themselves and wanted to remain the middle men. It's why the Elmina Castle was important to the Asantes. Control would mean they had an army or they controlled them politically or the many traits of a colonizer. At that time it would have been difficult for them to achieve such a feat. I think it's important to draw the distinction because our definition of conquering a people includes subjugation but there were so many instances of the Fantes defying the Asantes such as housing fugitives which would have been impossible for a subjugated people to do.  Edit: The Bono was a conquered tribe that was also assimilated into the Asante kingdom. They swore their allegiance to the Asante kingdom but subsequently still caused them trouble from time to time. The fugitives I mentioned earlier were I believe also Bono (I might be wrong with that one)."

However, an empire is defined as a state that has absorbed other states either through force or informal domination. Check [Marriam Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/empire) and [Britannica ](https://www.britannica.com/topic/empire-political-science). The Ashanti extended at 250,000 km2 which makes the larger than Atzec and Old Hittite empires. That size puts them in conversation with larger empires like Mitanni and ancient Carthage. The Ashanti Empire is really underrated by some Ghanaians."

Guys and girls all struggle to flow on these apps.  I've had many great chats in the past, but also many awkward ones. What works better usually is a face-to-face. Set up a simple date e.g. meet for a meal or drinks and chat somewhere public. Don't break the bank oo, the aim is to get the person to open up in conversation, not impress them with your wealth. If there's still no chemistry then cut your losses and move on."

It’s even worse if the girl grew up sheltered &/ went to a girls school.   Ghanaian girls are typically raised to focus on school/trade/job, household chores, God, and to ignore “vices” like boys, fun, outings & sex until much later in life. Families are especially harsh about premarital sex & teenage pregnancy, and religion reinforces this. So when it comes to romantic relationships, a lot of girls honestly don’t know what to do.   Her whole life she’s been told that boys are bad, they can ruin her life & only want sex. She’s also seen how badly people treat the so-called “bad girls” and how society shames them.   I think the balancing act of being careful, learning how to relate to guys who show interest, & figuring out her own likes & dislikes as she navigates romantic relationships is why some girls act like this in the beginning. It can take a while for them to open up & reveal their true selves and personalities.  There are also girls who have had bad experience(s) and developed very thick amour as a result. This can manifest in different ways, depending on the girl.  If you’re having trouble finding a compatible partner, I think you need to audit your selection & vetting process and make some changes. That may sound too formal but in a country of over 30 million people, there are definitely some age appropriate, attractive ladies you can vibe with.   Start by making friends through shared interests. People tend to be more relaxed when they’re having fun. Don’t put too much focus on romance when you 1st meet a girl because that can put some girls on high alert which could translate as awkward/stiff/boring/fake. Just get to know people & be friendly. Friendship is low stakes & if they don’t think you’re assessing them for romance/marriage they’re less likely to be guarded.   There’s a lid for every pot. Best of luck."

My only fear is GH females trying to emulate American girls. While not knowing that 90% of U.S. girls don’t even have a quality relationship. And since most all U.S. people of live through social media they’ll never have what they desire because the internet life is not real. My advice to you is get a female that’s ok with being regular, has something real going for herself, and accepts you for the person that you are. Anything else is a reach."

For some, they ask you how your day went, you reply with details and they just go ‘okay cool’. You ask them about theirs and they have nothing proper to say either.   If a conversation with a girl is not interesting it could be that she doesn’t like you, or something could be happening in that period you texted her.   There are boys who think I’m interesting and others who say I’m dry so I get it."

The bill doesn't prescribe how evidence can be gathered, and doesn't at all say (implicitly or otherwise) that we should spy on our neighbors. Now, this also means that if I, suspect you might have broken the law, I'd have to find that evidence in my own way, and I can't break the law while doing so.

There is no way  any European country can take decisions based on the perception of anyone. That is how they ensure a more harmonious society.  The tyranny of the majority is  what a secular constitution prevents.  Ignoring facts and evidence and assuming everyone is in the echo chamber.   A lot of Ghanaians are still not aware that the expression of LGBTQ is not a choice. The best example is like being left-handed or albinism. Statistics predict about 10% of the Ghanaian community to be LGBTQ like the rest of the world. Did you know transgender women have dicks? Transgender is the T in LGBTQ.  That is why it was illogical and ignorant for the Ga chief to compare the acceptance of LGBTQ with polygamy.  Christianity is not necessarily anti-LGBTQ. Europeans, Americans, and other Western Christians accept LGBTQ although they are the majority religion. The Bible emphatically prohibits things which Ghanaian Christian's gloss over. There is a long list . Religion is the worst reason to make law. Religion is personal. There are more than 2000 Christian religions in Ghana.  What Ghanaians do not know is that the entire anti LGBTQ campaign came from right wing American organisation who capitalised on the gullibility and vulnerability of Ghanaian churches. What they could not achieve in America they thought the could drum in the ears of Africans.  https://www.dw.com/en/lgbtq-in-africa-how-the-us-far-right-whips-up-homophobia/a-68562333  https://theconversation.com/us-christian-right-has-taken-aim-at-lgbtiq-rights-sex-education-and-abortion-in-africa-new-book-224877  Only a referendum can establish the validity of claims about LGBTQ"

However as I said, a referendum on the bill will only reject the bill not because of being anti gay. These politicians have ways to maneuver and manipulate such issues. Not to talk of the fact that this issue could easily unite the parties. A lot of rigging could go on.  If it comes down to a referendum, it's not the educated who will make the decision. Its the loud ones and those who are religious. Imagine the the preaching the pastors would give before the referendum.   They would stand against it. They would preach against it. Especially these one man churches. You can't imagine the power they have. Especially over the women. Then the cultural folks like Otumfuo and The Ga king. Even the dormaahene would be on otumfuo's side in this issue and those two hate each other.  You just don't want a referendum. It won't end well and would just secure the fate of many for years to come   Maybe you've not been in Ghana for a while. But that's one thing you don't mess with. Church and God. And if church and God say homosexuality is bad according to Ghanaian pastors, then so shall it be in ghana.  When I was in boarding school  years ago, they used to pray for boys suspected of homosexual tendencies. It was called being delivered.  Best bet; fight against the bill. Not the idea the bill claims to resolve. If you try fighting against the idea of a anti gay law, it will validate those who want it to their followers, supporters and fence sitters. Fight the nature and wording of the bill.   Lastly, I do think African politics doesn't fall into the same criteria of left and right wing politics as in the west. Whether far right entities are promoting homophobic policies in Africa, I think it would be interesting to investigate. I however wouldn't be surprised if it were true. But at the same time, it's like when the devil tempts a person. The person can refuse to sin.   I personally hate any form of western influence on Africa, its better if we find our way and learn from the mistakes of all those third world countries."

That is why some commenters said that makes the law unnecessary and there was no need. The other laws like incest or child abuse were of British origin. They forethought that it could be discovered and back prosecuted.  This cannot be done in the case of gays  One cannot illegally stop a motorist for no reason. Even if you find illegal substances.

But I will never tell anyone to stay in Ghana just because ""It's also hard in abrokyire"". It's very insulting and out of touch to do that imo.

Yes, in Ghana, you will get more when you win, but if things are not sailing smoothly, there is nothing wrong with traveling. Just don't stay out there for too long. Save as much capital as possible and do what you need to do back here.   Things to look out for  1. Citizens overseas will try to take advantage of you when they know you are illegal, so be careful. They keep complaining about foreigners moving overseas, but I see them hiring immigrants for cheap all the time and sometimes committing crime and making those immigrants a target. An international student or someone in a relationship with a citizen may be safe unless the other parties try to act illegally, too.   2. You will make more money BUT you will get a higher cost of living. So you gotta figure out how to save the difference over time. You could live cheap (which is hard bc would you live in an apartment with 6 other ppl? Maybe not, or maybe yes. BUT you really like your space, so I'm assuming it may be a YES but for a short time). If you try to date and have a baby on top of that on top of sending money back home, you are asking for problems. Simple.   3. Family planning. You are not going to like what I say as a Ghanaian but I will say it. If you met someone who can marry you to give you a green card, this does not apply to you. But if you single, you better chill. Yes, having a baby makes them a citizen in a country like the US. But, you still don't have a green card (your child is the citizen, not you), so you are still in trouble. And your child files for you when they are 18, but that's in 18 years. You can't wait that long. Your income is the same, and that baby is going to need money, a lot of money, which means less saving on difference. So thread wisely in this matter. Make sure you are married first with a green card, AND then get your baby ASAP.  4. You'll still have fun. Africans are out there, so you will find your community. This year is better than when Africans used to come in the 80s and 90s.   But PLEASE take advice from another African who is living the life you want NOT an African IN the same situation as you. If they tell you to start scamming for money, you better hold tight because now every transaction is tracked all over the globe. It's not like back then. How outside countries track you is beyond how Ghana tracks your every move. IF I suddenly made a purchase of 10K USD in the bank or moved 10K USD, the damn IRS (Internal revenue service, also known as The TAX FBI) will start investigating me for fraud. So move carefully when it comes to listening to African advice. In my experience, my fellow Africans give TERRIBLE financial advice unless they are already successful overseas because they dont know that finances are different overseas. So move with that information and move carefully.   5. Last. Handwork. Being skilled in sewing, hair, etc. If you are a man, you may want to consider doing women's hair. I'm SO SO SO SO SO serious. Don't ask me why, but thank me later. I'm not going to explain further. The only thing I will say is that my cousin just paid someone 700 dollars to get loc extensions, and this person is a guy who is not a US citizen. 700 dollars to cedis is how much? EXACTLY."

My Dad stayed in UK for 20+ years and came back after acquiring the skills and resources to make it in Ghana. The UK is a hustle for people who don’t make it there legitimately. Like every country if you go there with no money you will struggle at first. What I’ve learnt from this all is that grass isn’t greener there are incomparable struggles on each side. I could easily say that Ghana for me is better than the UK but I speak from a more privileged position. The lack of system in Ghana has many disadvantages but there are advantages in a sense that every class can find hacks to play it to their strengths whereas in UK if you are working class it is very likely you will stay working class.

I’m living it meanwhile you’re googling   It appears you have a habit of making assumptions. I have lived in the uk for more than  6 years and  more than 10 elsewhere in other parts of Europe and the US and have also lived and worked in ghana. Complaining about London being expensive is like complaining about labone or Ridge being expensive in ghana. I made it clear that where you live plays a factor. If you earn 7k in ghana a month, you are taking trotro to work, you have no generator, and you are going to be sleeping in the dark on some days.  occasional water shortages, you have to be  selective where you buy lunch from when you are at work as you can't afford certain prices, you have to careful about how ypu use your internet as you cant afford too much. All am comparing is standard of living of someone making 7k in ghana is much below someone making 2.1k in the uk. Keep in mind most degree holders ghana earn between 3-5k, some with masters aren't getting above 5k. There are apartments in labone over 1.5 k dollars a month, and yes, they actually charge in dollars. Assuming you are living alone. Someone who earns 2100 in uk is living better than someone who earns 7k in ghana. Also, I am making my statements, having lived in different cities outside of London, while working. So no, there was no Google involved."

Also what you describe is pretty much the Ghanian government defaulting on the debt, do you have any news coverage confining this? If it is true others will be affected, governments don't issue Eurobonds to only one person so he wouldn't be the only one affected and it would be public news if the government of Ghana defaults like that.

Very very sad indeed.  Let me find out Nigeria is a safer place to invest after all! I invested in a Eurobond in Nigeria while seasoning an account I couldn’t withdraw from and it paid out as promised, and that was about 7yrs ago and the naira was weaker than the cedi today.   I’ve only purchased land in Ghana, and that feels shaky. Good to know cash investment in securities and bonds is completely inadvisable.

Some people on this Ghana reddit need to get their heads out of their backsides. The defensiveness regarding obvious problems in our society is really putting me off of the Ghana reddit. Any little criticism of our country or culture is almost seen as a personal insult. Please grow up!  Colorism is a huge problem in this country. Plenty of dark skinned people grow up thinking they're ugly and undesirable because of years of teasing and pestering over their color. People saying asinine things along the lines of ""98% of Ghanaians are dark skinned so colorism can't be a problem here"", are you ok? Are you even from Ghana? We are not talking about light and dark skinned from a Western perspective. In Ghana, we differentiate between different shades of ""dark"" skinned. And the darkest skinned ones are often considered ugly by default, by large sections of society. A lot of girls struggle badly due to this. People denying this are ignorant, or they're dishonest... According to multiple studies, an estimated 26% to 65% of Ghanaians, predominantly women, bleach their skin, depending on where exactly in Ghana they are. Probably more prevalent in the cities and among those who can afford it. It's extremely common, and difficult to miss once you know what you're looking for. Lighter skinned women get much more attention and opportunities than darker skinned ones. I'm a light skinned man (mom is white), and some people will literally prostrate themselves to me (I absolutely hate that!). Some women practically throw themselves at me (I never indulge them when it's obvious that they just like my color). Children go out of their way to greet me in the politest way possible, often ignoring everyone else around me, even though they know I'm local. Some of the younger ones think I'm Jesus, because of my hair and beard. Some even refer to me as ""angel"". It's very awkward... Doors open themselves for me, and generally speaking people treat me much better than my darker skinned counter parts even though I'm just a Ghanaian living in this country and everyone in my community knows that. In fact, I'm a Rasta with a large beard and dreadlocks almost reaching my knees. If I was a dark skinned Rasta, Ghanaian society would be very difficult to navigate for me. But because of my color, I experience color privilege. Which is the exact opposite of what I experienced in Europe, where I experienced discrimination, violent racism and police harassment. And yes, our media landscape is awash with people much lighter skinned than the average Ghanaian, and the lighter skinned characters in movies and series are often portrayed as the ""pretty"" or ""desirable"" ones, while the darkest skinned characters are often seen as the ""bad"", ""evil"", ""backward"" or ""comical"" characters. I literally can't stand Ghanaian media, in part due to the implicit and very prevalent colorism. Of course not everyone thinks like this, and there are plenty of people who love dark skin. But they are a minority and that's a problem in a predominantly dark skinned country. Personally, I think dark skin is very beautiful. Some people in this country literally think I'm joking when I say that."

If being light skin isn’t seen as more preferable or attractive why do people bleach? Is it that it’s because they want to express their creativity? Or experiment somehow? I want people to answer with their explanations and let’s see if the notion of light skin supremacy isn’t part.  Many Ghanaians don’t like to hear the truth at alllllll.

But to add to all that is said, colourism is real in Ghana. From the young ones to the old. A few percentage of the population who don't discriminate against people based on their shade of colour are either those who are enlightened or understand that it's a natural thing, and so it shouldn't be battled. I myself suffered more on this issue of colourism when I was in Junior High School because my shade at that time was very dark; but now it's not as it was. The majority of my mates made me feel bad, but because of my facial attractiveness and academic excellence, it wasn't intense. So OP is actually right ✅️ in his argument.  Light shades of the same dark skin are prioritised against the other. It's a mental issue among most people in Ghana."

This is really crazy because all my aunts and uncles are very racist against like any person who isn’t white. We have indigenous American heritage and I’ve only recently pinpointed it to the Dominican Republic/Haiti. The country has a highly melanated population and I can see the resemblance except for the light skin that makes us look sickly and I can only come up with one logical reason how I have blue eyes and it’s because white is something that is done to a population. Our diet in the US consists of a lot of chemicals used to mine gold. Chlorine (bleach) in the water when combined with stomach acids will dissolve gold. Sugars in every beverage precipitates gold and causes us to expel it. Gold is the reason our blood is the color that it is. Formaldehyde separates gold from a solution and that’s what they flush corpses bodies out with and I have a dozen other facts that point to that but I wanted to mention that my uncles aren’t racist because they hate the different people around them. My family lineage has been indoctrinated to believe anything other than white is bad. Colonization is creating self hatred by creating delusions inside of people by making them hate what they are and they will begin to defend and support their colonial leaders in order to fit in and overlook who they actually are. It’s embarrassing but white is a sickness from being in a system that demelanates people mining them for precious metals and other valuable resources

I do think that Ghana is one of the most pro black west African counties. We really do love our dark skin and natural features BUT there is still a part of our culture in which the language around light skin and dark skin can be problematic. Bleaching still takes place so there clearly is an issue with skin tone and the language around “toning or clearing up your complexion” or “let your complexion glow” all that language insinuates your natural dark skin is somehow not good enough.  It’s worse in other countries though but we do have an issue and people should be able to freely talk about it.

You are easily dismissing it as if you have the right to invalid other people experiences. Op has observed it through film, and i assume local flim, and also draw it from her own experience growing up.   Op took issue with the portray of dark skin characters in one of the TV series - if i am correct.  So yes, it's a global issue, but in the African context, it's different and perhaps even more different in Ghana. We have 1000s of tribes in Africa, and with that comes tribalism. Now, that's just before you add colonialism. To complex for this thread -  So back to Op comment. I think it's supper important that we talk about these issues, especially when it's coming from within our own communities. How could local producers not understand the potential consequences of such portray? Maybe the film industry needs better guidelines? Maybe we are worshiping the wrong God?"

So far as that is what makes them feel how they want to feel, it makes them feel confident they're ready to pay any price for it, whether it's cancer or whatever. The pressure from society is also one to consider, being that they make them feel inferior and the victims don't have enough self-esteem to ward those negative perceptions other people hold against them. As stated earlier too, they feel like they are beautiful enough, they have bleach. People also tend to follow the dominant narrative too, “what's the trend? That's the trend.

I want to add more context. Barya was the name of who we call today, Nara people, who are phenotypically dark skinned. It wasn't derogatory. Over time, because they were frequently victims of slave trade in the region, their name became synonymous with ""slave"" to other tribes speaking Semitic languages. Barya may be used to denote someone's dark skin, such as the singer Yemane Barya stage name. I agree it's use can be to demean, but it's not originally meant like that and it didn't originally mean slave."

I didn’t actively engage in discussions about skin tone so not familiar with that phrase. The most I know is broni or “korkor” to refer to someone’s skin tone but nothing I heard was ever derogatory to light skinned people. If anything it was often discussed in a positive light if I heard some reference it.   Colourism is the discriminatory treatment of people with darker skin tones with the notion that light skin is better than dark skin. It is not the general discrimination of people based on skin tone. It is specifically something created to discriminate against dark skinned people. A joke or nickname about light skin, whilst insensitive, wrong and annoying, is not the same as how dark skin is portrayed, spoken about or denigrated so widely and openly world wide.  And like I said, if I enter Ghana today the likelihood of me experiencing direct and open colourism is so slim so it’s not an issue that I’d say is so big that it is creating a generation of people that feel inferior, BUT we can’t invalidate the real lives experiences of people who have been discriminated against."

Because before the show was released it was approved so the writers, directors and producers all thought the scripts was appropriate which means they beleive there’s an audience in Ghana that would resonate with that statement and find it funny/relatable. So that denotes there exists a societal view about dark skinned and it connotations that is generally accepted. Similar with dread locks - Ghanaians are known to have historically had a very big problem with anyone wearing them and they attached negative connotations. They do the same with dark skin sometimes and they also attach preferential comments to lighter skinned people, often around their beauty.   Yes, here in the UK it is 1000x worse and in the US too. In Asia they also experience it, India, Pakistan, Korea, Japan and China all have this issue, but this commentary is from a Ghanaian and she’s bringing it to a Ghana platform so I think that’s okay.   I don’t like how when it comes to this topic people feel the need to tell us to shut up and keep quiet. They also make it seem like it’s all in our heads but we know what we’ve gone through. Really, it’s gaslighting 101.   I think colourism is as important as racism, texturism, featurism and tribalism but it might not be as important to you and that’s okay. But if you ever have a daughter who will be dark skinned you will need to inform yourself of these things so you can empower her and not invalidate her feelings and experiences as that can cause so much damage."

I’ve read a lot of literature on Ghana’s independence. Kwame Nkrumah did take the most advanced civil service in Africa and he trashed it. He took over a nation with healthy foreign reserves and he emptied it completely. The ordinary Gold Coaster had more personal liberties than the ordinary Ghanaian under Kwame Nkrumah. We went from a freely elected legislature and prime minister under British rule to a communist life-president under Nkrumah. I think we’d have been better off gaining independence 30 years later, with a more educated citizenry, and under better leadership than Kwame Nkrumah."

What I am saying is, in the heat of suffering, losing your autonomy feels so much better than actually saving yourself.   If the British HAD kept Ghana, they would have probably used the nation to help Britain's recovery from WW2, accelerating the recovery of Britain. They would have also had to keep Ghana while letting the USA in. This probably would have led to US business dominating the region, with a racialized class system fermenting into place.

They started chasing us in the 8 - 11th century. We don’t talk about it. We only talk about the Europeans because that’s recent.   The Akans came to settle in Ghana in the 11th Century, the Ga-Adamgbe came, The Dagombas n Gonjas came, the Ewes came in ~14th.   Majority of these groups came from the old Ghana Empire. Just FYI, it was a medieval West African empire that existed from approximately 300 to 1200 CE. Its territory is now divided among several modern countries in West Africa.  Presently, the area that was once the Ghana Empire can be located in:  1. Southeastern Mauritania 2. Southwestern Mali 3. Eastern Senegal 4. Northern Guinea 5. Western Burkina Faso  The empire’s core region was located in what is now modern-day Mali, between the Niger and Senegal rivers. The capital city, also called Ghana, is believed to have been located near the modern-day town of Koumbi Saleh in southeastern Mauritania.  The Europeans joined in the 14th century. They did us dirty. We did ourselves dirty as well. Africa is so tribalistic. I think it’s because of our topographical geography, it was harsh and you can only survive on forming a tribe.   Some people because of ignorance think that being Akan, Ga or Ewe means anything. It means nothing actually.   My point is that we shouldn’t blame the whites or Arabs too much but ourselves.   Even our own Nkrumah standing before the major ethnic groups of Africa begging them for our UNITY listened to him not. Nigeria, Ethiopia, mention them.

The west on the other hand has shown a consistent pattern of rapacious consumption everywhere they go in the world, even though they started it at home(ask the Irish).

The political seat might be the very final stage/form it takes. Telling another man/race that they're (or their type is) inferior to you is what I call colonisation. The first slaves were sent out of the continent in the early 1400s. We know the whites didn't fight wars to capture their slaves, so since the early 1400s, we can say various African kings and kingdoms had been ""answering to the white man"" in one form or another. We can call them ""trade"" but we know ""mirrors, gins, and gunpowders"" for ""slaves"" is not fair trade. If anything, it shows that colonialism was working.  The fact he might not have ""answered to a white man"" doesn't mean colonialism didn't begin before him."

They did colonize and integrate regions near it. Cantonese, Wu, innermongolia and my beloved Manchuria.   It's more akin to the Russian and Roman form of colonialism or the British to the Irish form.  It's less so colonialism as a traditional sense but colonialism in a integration sense.  Similar to what Americans do to natives. They are here to make us them.  Which is still horrific and something we must address with equal scrutiny. It's still inhumane.    (I'm firmly against the notion of my enemies enemy is my friend since even though China didn't harm Africa they are harming east turkmenistan, thus a colonial power. Same for America)  So European colonialism in recent times was more outwards, Asian is a combination of the two as Japan colonized parts of china like the Europeans did to Africa but also attempted to integrate Korea like China did to Manchu or Britain did to Ireland.   So I still don't believe it's westernisms it's just goals and objectives.   Heck in China you also have people ok with being a cog like in Ghana. Like the Cantonese who have started accepting the mandarin language and erasing their Cantonese identity just to be a pawn and not a individual...  But there are also people like you and I there fighting for their right to remain Cantonese and even attempted to win independence.   Colonialism is bad no matter if its outwards or integration.  We all have unique skills, languages and views that must be protected at all costs. I recommend that you read a book called Language Death by David Crystal.  It paints a clear picture why both forms must be stopped at all costs.     And yes those people in ops post I see as a form of integrationist... you can have such people from any culture to any culture..."

There's an island in East Africa called Mayotte, during decolonization the people there refused independence and chose to remain part of France hence technically they are administered by the French government, however they are still as poor as the rest of Africa who became independent. Simply because all resources that could be used to help them will be sent to mainland France improving the lives if those in Europe while leaving those in africa in poverty  In return for living in poverty, they are all born with French citizenship and are hence members of the EU, their currency is also the Euro.

You can sell 'branded shirts', alright, but a brand has much more behind it than just the clothes.   You've rightly identified that marketing is the key, but the key to marketing is identity. There should be a consistent theme, and I'm not saying they should look similar; I mean, there should be a connecting element between every piece of clothing that you release. That is a brand.   Nike has their theme of empowerment and performance, emphasized by their bold, athletic designs and even their slogan, 'Just Do It.' Supreme's core identity is rooted in street culture and exclusivity, so they often go for very bold branding, limited exclusives & collaborations, etc.  In the same way, you should find something that you can connect to and build your brand on. That's what becomes the very backbone of your brand. It's only then that you can make something scaleable of your brand."

I won't put a dot on a shirt and sell it.. every design I made in this collection was from an artwork I made in the past.. that has deep meaning once you sit down to digest it. i just gave an example.... just like the banana on the wall that sold for $6M ?? or 60M.. can't remember the exact value.. but it was through marketing.. thats how a 5 cedis banana attached to a wall with duct tape got sold for $6M"

I'll start this brand off taking preorders ?  dude.. whatever you said there made a point. but you could have said it better. next time read whatever comment you want to put out and think if it'll sit well with you if you were on the receiving end. have a nice day.

I'd suggest selling them online for about half the price to get a following. At 250 cedis, that's about $20 and to be honest you can buy t shirts in U.S for alot less than that. Just my 2 cents. Good luck though and the designs are good."

I'd be straight up honest with you and let you know that my profit margin is less than 20%. I'm probably going to rack up losses with this first collection. I'm just trying to get my name out with this one.   so yeah.. in a way you're right.. 20$ can get you t-shirts in the us.. how much does it cost to make them.. are they brand new or thrifted.. what's the quality difference.. and all that.. but yeah.. I do get your pov.

Cheddar does not know the operations of the government apparatus. A president has to work with parliament. He has to somehow seek the approval of the majority of parliamentarians to pass any laws. This is not a monarchy or dictatorship. If anyone is voting for the Atlantic to be brought to Kumasi, parliament is probably not going to go along with.

Cheddar has some great ideas; I will give him credit for that, but where is the foundation to accomplish all the things he is saying? Do we have the money to do even some of them? It means more loans, and more loans mean conditions that come with each loan we take. All the leaders are just bad. How do we solve this and work on building a strong foundation: education, healthcare, and other important things? So far, none of the candidates have stated anything concrete to address these issues. It’s all games and saying things to appease the masses."

It’s a flawed system that creates the illusion of choice when, in reality, the NPP and NDC are merely playing a game of ping pong with Ghana’s future. This issue isn't unique to Ghana; it's prevalent in many other democracies as well. Breaking this cycle would require an extraordinary level of awareness, education, and public unity. Ironically, those who are most suited to lead are often the ones who have no desire to become president, while those who do seek the position are often the least suited for it. It’s quite a paradox."

The legislature will always present stumbling blocks regardless of how much experience you have and politicians are commodities that can be bought. They're not some principled hard-headed individuals that wouldn't compromise on their values, they have no values to begin with.  Ghana's constitution is alarmingly executive-centric.

Talking of him having clear political philosophy, let's not kid ourselves, if this guy should win he is going to overhaul everything, which is what we really need either for the best or worst.

If this policy was created in the west it would be shredded by intellectuals and think tanks immediately. Even me without basic economic knowledge knows you can’t without the demand, you can’t just artificially create a supply. Sure businesses can run 24 hours but even if they do where is the demand going to come from ? Is it just going to manifest out of thin air ?   At the basic level if someone selling kenkey all of sudden starts running his or her operation 24 hours, it doesn’t mean they will have customers for all those new hours they are open ? There is a reason that a lot of businesses in the west don’t run 24 hours, it doesn’t make business sense. Not to talk less of the electricity required for this ? Even now we have difficulties with electricity, imagine the electricity costs.   All of this is a complex issue which needs to be analyzed. But as usual in Ghana, cheap slogans are used."

Stocks for these commercial offices plummeted, surrounding businesses suffered because the opportunity for people to engage in the economy is no longer there.

They are not selling at 3 am because there is not enough demand to sustain whatever expenses they will incur.    The majority of fast food restaurants don’t operate 24 hours, car dealerships, shopping malls don’t operate 24 hours I guess they should go and educate on how to it with their 24 hour economy. They only establishments you see in the west running 24 hours are health care facilities and factories which do that to meet production targets. They aren’t doing it government told them they are operating a 24 hour economy.   The economy is running all the time. It doesn’t have anything to do with 24 hour economy. The pandemic is a one off event which affected many businesses which were affected by the lockdown. Many people were forced to work from home due to the lockdowns. Now that these restrictions are lifted, employers are trying to get the workers back into the offices but are finding challenges as workers now see that working from home has many benefits including lowering commuting costs for them and also the stress of commuting. They can also live further away from their jobs as they don’t need live as close to work. This has nothing to do with 24 hour economy.

Equality rights are part of the Ghana Constitution. The place and the way they are uttered make it obvious that they are listed. The list is finite. Sexual preference or how ever it might be defined is not in the list, hence regulations by the state that sanction a behaviour are lawful. This was obvious (to anyone who can read) from the start.  As to the question of the behaviour being private: this is not true. There are groups in Ghana that are financed by foreign entities, who would create public disruption. These can now be monitored and stopped.  Some might remember that EU projects entailed schoolbooks for young children with explicit pictures of genitalia.   It is the sovereign right of every nation, every people, every culture to live within their own set of laws and not bow to the laws of any perceived ""masters"".   I will leave this subreddit now.   You had the chance of engaging with someone who actually knows how the constitution was created, the reason for parliamentary democracy in a multi-party system, the voting system, who invented the Round Table, why Ghana cannot develop beyond a certain point, how religious and tribal groups are being manipulated into choosing what will keep them dependent on ridiculously few ""Masters"", etc.  My disappointment is immeasurable."

Gupta (2008) (https://www.hrw.org/report/2008/12/17/alien-legacy/origins-sodomy-laws-british-colonialism) (this source makes it VERY clear where Ghana got its sodomy laws from, as it is included in the list of African nations that got their sodomy laws from Britain, with this plus:  The Ghanaian code differs from other British-derived Penal Codes in Africa in that consensual “buggery,” while a crime, is defined only as a misdemeanor.  Ghanaian law does not derive directly from the Indian Penal Code (or the Queensland Penal Code)-as do most other British-African codes, as explained below. Its ancestor was a draft prepared for Jamaica by the liberal British jurist R.S. Wright, who was heavily influenced by the libertarian ideals of the philosopher John Stuart Mill. (Mill famously wrote that “the only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others”: Mill, On Liberty  (Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1974), p. 68).  Wright’s draft code was never applied in Jamaica but became the basis for Ghanaian law. See M. L. Friedland, “R. S. Wright’s Model Criminal Code: A Forgotten Chapter in the History of the Criminal Law,” Oxford Journal of Legal Studies, Vol. 1, No. 3 (Winter 1981), pp. 307-346. )  Grottanelli, Vinigi. 1988. “The python killer: Stories of Nzema life”, p.g. 210 (https://archive.org/details/pythonkillerstor00grot/page/209/mode/2up?view=theater&q=Teenager) and Signorini, Italo. 1971. “Angawale azzale: il matrimonio tra individui dello stesso sesso negli Nzema del Ghana sud-occidentale.” Rassegna Italiana di Sociologia 12: 529-45 (both talk about friendship marriages surrounding men in Nzema (ANOTHER Akan group). Vinigis is the best source here as it does put it up for interpretation what kind of relationship this is (friends with benefits could be on the cards, although it is uncertain)  Ivor Wilks, Akwamu 1640-1750.

They all carry the theme that the Akan religion, exclusive of British influence had homosexuality in its culture and simply allow people to be homosexual if they so please, with the religion saying NOTHING when it came to such relationships. There isn’t a single law prior to the British’s sodomy law that criminalised homosexuality. And on that note, homosexuality in Ghana came from one place and it was Ghana itself. Britain couldn’t have done it as up till recently, they were raging homophobes whom are in the reason why Ghana is so homophobic in actual fact. On that note, if homosexuality didn’t exist in the Gold Coast prior to the British, why did the British feel the need to introduce a sodomy law? Again, it’s isn’t just impossible, it is embarrassing if you believe colonial Britain is the reason for Ghana have homosexuals. If anything, it is the exact opposite"

Personally, Digitization for instance has been a game changer. Look, I’m able to use my Ghanacard for Taxes, SSNIT and NHIS.  I don’t remember the last time I stepped into a bank to do any transaction because of mobile money interoperability.   When I run out of electricity, I just make payment via my phone and the lights come back.   With ECG again, my parents were wrongly billed on their postpaid meter, and all I did was to file a complaint via the ECG mobile app last November and it was corrected. Ended up having so much credit, that it only got exhausted this month.  I once registered my two businesses online without stepping foot at the registrar generals department. (Portal is offline at the moment)  I stepped out in my neighborhood and saw two major infrastructure projects ongoing, much to my surprise. Something I never would have thought of.  I’m optimistic , and I feel we can get there one day, probably not in our lifetime 😁😁. For us to have some clarity about what’s ahead, we first need to chase this government out."

The systems we live under were often designed by those who didn’t share our cultural heritage, and over time, we’ve lost touch with the very things that set us apart.   The key issue is that we’ve stopped valuing our own strengths and, in doing so, have allowed external systems to dictate how we live and think. To overcome this, we need a mindset shift—one that embraces our heritage, our way of life, and innovates based on that foundation. It’s not about rejecting progress, but about redefining it in a way that works for us, so we can move forward on our own terms.  It’s definitely a challenging perspective, but it’s time to challenge the norms that aren’t serving us and start thinking about how we can build systems that reflect who we are."

One would divert their money and time, which would have been spent to get some service, into something much more profitable. For example, my mom took me to school in the eastern region to get my prospectus for school when she could have been working to earn money. She lost a whole day of income and had to spend on transportation to get the two of us to the school. Just last year, my nephew confirmed his place in his chosen school and got his prospectus on his phone. All he did next was pack his stuff and report to school on the opening day.

However, she delayed a little because of one of the things that I had asked her to get for me. She missed that trotro and boarded another.  As the journey progressed, she reached a part of the road that was untarred, much narrower, and consequently filled with traffic. There was a massive boulder overlooking a large ditch to the right of the road (it had been there for many years). She saw the trotro that she had missed crash into that boulder, and the horrific injuries that resulted. I won't be too graphic, but she saw people lose limbs and appendages. The driver (who was speeding) was unharmed.  A contractor had started fixing the road months prior, because of the upcoming election. Now, a few months after this horrific incident, the road has been tarred, and the large boulder is gone. The huge ditch however, is still there.  So we have a situation where people have been permanently disabled (possibly killed) because:  1. one of the worst of a long line of corrupt governments clearly waited until the election was close to fix this road. 2. our transportation system is dominated by rickety, decades-old, deathtraps crammed with people, which are often driven by unlicensed and intoxicated men.  Horror unfolds in this country every day, and when it happens, it is we who will be left caring for our disabled loved-ones. The politicians who work for themselves, and our colonizers (Ghana is a neo-colonial state. Neocolonialism is an indirect approach to colonisation, where the control is through economic policies, and corrupt politicians. Nkrumah published a book about it a year before he was overthrown) won't even know it happened, nor do they care.  I don't believe in our political system, and I expect nothing different from the next government."

To answer your question, there are other ways of ensuring people move around if they don’t have private vehicles, that is what the government is supposed to be handling.  solution:  1. The govt should work on providing public buses and develop Ghana‘s public transportation system.  2. 6 month checks on private buses (if Ghanaians insist on trotros, but I think they should be discontinued). If their vehicles done pass roadworthy safety checks, they shouldn’t be allowed to drive it, and if they’re caught it should be taken from them. Perhaps they should also  be given the chance to sell their trotros for scraps."

Ghanaian men actually don’t give a care about what Gisela does or doesn’t do. It’s insignificant in the grand scheme of things. I didn’t even know her until all these.  What Ghanaian men care about is the constant perpetuation to impressionable youth the notion that it is some kind of slavery to even cook or iron for your male partner but instead as women, they ought to be worshipped with no obligation on their side. To test the credibility of this notion, reverse the scenario - where the guy does nothing and the woman actually does all the work and feeds the family, comes back home to sweep and cook like Gisela’s boyfriend. You will all be up in arms (just like OP did in their post). That’s the hypocrisy that her supporters are masking with their condescension.  Ask ALL of them if they would allow their brothers to be in such relationships and you will hear a big no. On top of that, for such an independent and “we don’t give an f about men” type generation, such women for some reason ALWAYS center their lives around the provisions of the men they date to the point the first criteria of dating any man is how deep his pockets go.  “But it’s her own life allow her to live it” is another frankly stupid thing to say given the fact that absolutely no one requested her personal life information but she willfully put it into the public domain for us to have these discussions."

The dynamics have changed but certain core elements remain and are expected. Cooking, taking care of the children and other things are assigned to the woman while the man provides all finances and maintains order and structure in the home.   In most failed marriages I have witnessed, one partner fails to do their bit and the other partner either picks up the slack and becomes overwhelmed or resentful. Disrespect creeps in and it ultimately leads to separation or divorce. ESP when the woman has to also turn provider in addition to taking care of the house.   And u are operating under an assumption that rich men don’t care about these thing but I assure you they really care. I have seen a rich man who lets the wife cook his meals fresh everyday and the food has to be ready by 4pm. The wife makes sure he gets it everyday. And he’s not the only one but he’s the one I have witnessed (all other were heard from third parties ).  So I guess all I’m saying is that marriage revolves on the idea that both individuals have a part to play and thinking marriage is solely on the woman’s duties is grossly unfair and wrong"

Her man pays for the meals, dates and everything and she said she never pays and her man never allows her to. It sounds to me that the man is very considerate and cares about her enough to give everything but she is not considerate enough to reciprocate in ways that will also show the man that she is also contributing to the relationship in a meaningful way.

Its just that now, if things aren't working, you can leave without too much social stigma. Before this, there were documented instances of women straight up [murdering](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giulia_Tofana) their husbands because it was their only way out of domestic abuse. Now, just get a lawyer. So ofcourse divorce numbers go up.   The goal shouldn't be less divorces. It should be less unhappy couples, which would result in less divorces as a by-product.  The marrying less is simply a direct result of becoming a developed society. Lots of things that come with a developed society make getting married and having lots of kids more difficult, or at least undesirable, hence low birthrates and constrictive population pyramids."

The difference is most Western countries have protections that, while still imperfect and not nearly adequate enough, grant some measure of safety and financial security to divorcees (particularly women), protections that are practically non-existent in most African countries.   It means couples in the West are markedly more likely to report instances of domestic abuse and violence and seek divorce, vs in Africa. It's still not even close to being good or comprehensive enough in the West, but some framework exists.   In Africa you just have to suffer through it and hope you survive long enough and your husband doesn't kill you or cheat or abandon you, or risk divorce and end up as a single parent with no guarantee of child support and the scorn and gossiping of useless community people praying for your downfall."

Some African norms are superior to Western ones don't get me wrong, but the institution of marriage is certainly not one of them.   African families, on average, suffer from patriarchal imbalances where power ends up concentrated in the hands of the husband. On average Western women have more of a say in what goes on in their household than do African women. Bank accounts are often shared and managed together, and expenses are jointly decided on. Women are on average freer to have careers, decide how many kids to have, etc. There are more protections for wives seeking divorce due to marital abuse, cheating, etc.   In African if your husband cheats, people will say it's because the women isn't giving him what he needs. If the wife is abused and goes to the police they are more likely to advocate she go back to her husband and talk to him and try to settle things amicably, which means most women are trapped in abusive relationships with no recourse for relief, especially with the stigma surround divorce. It means if the husband wants 5 children the woman is often obliged to give him 5, and she has little say in the matter. It means when the man has 5 children and realises how expensive or time intensive raising five kids is, he is often able to either leave all that work to his wife or just leave them outright and go cheat.   The social norms you're arguing for so strongly are ones where women take the more subservient position and men are the leaders in the household."

The issues are so deep rooted that actually Ghana needs a dictator, one that doesn't need money and one that is a visionary.  Not needing money means their own personal well being is resolved so they don't have to chop. It also means that they can move politicians along who they didn't have to bribe to get into power and force the country in a specific direction.  One major issue I see with this?

However it is not for the reasons that inspired your post.  For example it is not necessary to have all Ministries in one area. In Europe the headquarters of ministries can be spread nationwide because all processing  is done online. It is so consequential because it removes corruption and bribery entirely.  The only grouping that should be in the capital is parliament just for the reason that we have the building already there. Notwithstanding, we can build a whole new administrative capital away from Accra, with modern high rise housing for civil servants.   In fact, we can then transfer most of the Governmental operation to the new place. Then we enact proper regulations like most of the developed world involving architectural designs and controls to stop hawking in the streets, littering, bad parking, crowded streets. In this case the city is so designed that you can't park anywhere, or hawk or gather in unauthorized places.  It will  take centuries to allow the behaviour of Africans to evolve voluntarily. Rather they should be made to behave  well through planning. This happens all the time. They suddenly have to learn  to behave in London, Paris, Washington  etc. because they can't act the way they do in their hometown."

Africans have to be the ones to start their own revolution, then we will help. Else you will be dragging a horse dying from thirst to the water pond, one that tries to bite you and refuses to drink.  When they fight for their own countries, shed blood and lives, it is then they will only be truly grateful for their freedom from local and foreign oppressors.     We can make modest financial investments on a gradual basis in terms of business opportunities. But a nation of cowards will be a nation of sellouts, even for the benefit of their oppressors,  whether they be local or foreign.

But there can be no economic freedom without revolution led by people who understand power, politics and want a better country overall.     ""We can be free, isolated from world markets, and poor like Haiti."" Haiti is still not free and they actually lost the war for their freedom as France and America team up to destroy Haiti. Haiti is not poor because they cant govern themselves. They are very capable, but unfortunately, they live next door to the biggest imperialist in the world.   You should read this   [https://library.brown.edu/create/modernlatinamerica/chapters/chapter-14-the-united-states-and-latin-america/moments-in-u-s-latin-american-relations/a-history-of-united-states-policy-towards-haiti/](https://library.brown.edu/create/modernlatinamerica/chapters/chapter-14-the-united-states-and-latin-america/moments-in-u-s-latin-american-relations/a-history-of-united-states-policy-towards-haiti/)  Watch this   [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtuffRdjGyg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtuffRdjGyg)     ""Both the Chinese and Jews rose out of poverty and into power by the boom of consumerism in America. 1950s through the 1990s made them who they are today and now they can thrive off their own middle class. Those who got rich during that time reached back home and taught others the system.""  The Chinese were 80 percent illiterate in 1940. The American companies saw they could make lots of money by moving low level manufacturing to China. Hence you got the sweat shops where they made clothes, shoes, plastics and the western companies became very wealthy due to cheap labour.  Then the Chinese government invested in education in its population and so western tech companies salivated at cheap educated labor and moved to china mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan.  The Chinese who went to the west were educated richer Chinese who got in due to the civil rights movement where black Americans sacrificed the most. They didn't need to come back home as the Chinese were already on their way educating the masses. But some did indeed come back home and work for the government. However most stayed. That's why the Asian population has exploded in America since the civil rights act.      ""Need to have a fair business partnership with a large base of consumers.""  There will never be a fair business relationship with the West. Weak can't demand from the strong, unless the strong is opposed by another strong force that is willing to make alliances with the weak. Ghana already has a large local consumer base and at least 1.5 billion on the continent. Ghana is almost all consumerism, so there is already a ready market, with raw materials, and so the manufacturing sector has lots of room.  ""Financial literacy and getting people to stop building idols or idolizing things/individuals is the only way.""  I agree, but people must be literate ( not just the ability to read words) before they can be financial literate.  The revolution must be physical first, led by wise knowledgeable people who want a better country and aren't afraid to die for it. Then there must be country wide agricultural reforms for sustainable food production and local industry.   Ghana can trade natural resources to china in exchange for equipment for industry. In terms of educational infrastructure and scientific knowledge, willing experienced  qualified diasporas including African Americans or as a least resort Chinese educators can be used for scientific and stem learning only.  There must also be true history taught to the youth from the time they are young about the relations between the west, the world and Africa, the history of pre Ghana, Ghana, and history of Africa. A sense of loyalty from the kids and a unanimous drive to better Ghana as a whole and be opposed to any person who is destroying or is abusing their power.  But like I said, agricultural sustainability is the most important first. Then after that stability, low level production and manufacturing, and then free full fledge stem education from young to university. And finally to local tech industry. There must be a local ecosystem first that brings self sufficiency, then Ghana can expand outside.    Ghana can't be isolated from the world as the western power is not the only world power. The time is right for a revolution when you have 3 superpowers in the world and two are working together and currently at odds with the sitting superpower in Africa. Aka the west."

I watched the Haiti video and I can agree my statement was incorrect. When I mentioned we can be “free” and isolated like Haiti, I meant freedom by the standards of the western imperialists. What’s going on there is the same CIA move they’ve used on several countries. They did it to Ghana. Howard Bane of the CIA constructed the plan to have Kotoka overthrow Nkrumah while on a visit in Vietnam.   This effectively stopped the growing relationship we were trying to build with China and the Soviet Union. Nkrumah did so much for West Africa in the short time he was president and most Ghanaian people don’t know.  A fair business relationship for Ghana is to export goods consistently even if there is more profit for the western country. We cannot solely rely on Cocoa. We can look down on cheap labor but it’s better than high unemployment rates. Labor is not just about money but it’s also a sense of purpose and dignity to have the opportunity to get up and just work. The more dignity an individual has, they will make better micro and macro decisions because of it.   Revolutions are bloody and lengthy processes and many countries don’t come out better than they were before. The idea that China or Russia would be significantly better partners is false. Every superpower wants their turn to take advantage of the world. From the Portuguese to the Dutch to the Brits to the Americans and up next we have the Chinese. Humans are innately self absorbed when in position of power. The world has always been this way. It’s a long history but let’s not be mistaken and believe west Africa never ruled a part of the world. 11th and 12th century we were great empires. It may not happen again in our lifetime but eventually it will."

The west has never offered a fair trade. How will you make them?  We have to look at it from several angles. Which superpower is most adversely affected by a rise of Africa and a fair deal for resources?  The obvious answer is the one that needs the minerals the most and don't have something of equal value to trade for. In the external fiat system, they get real finite resources and ghana gets infinte worthless 'paper' soon to be nothing more than air when you go ' digital'.  Fiat is fine in a closed financial ecosystem where the country's resources is used for and by the people and makes it easier to trade items between the people via cash or ' coupons'.   If we have no car, but want a car and we go to a dealer, rip a page from an exercise book and write on it 1,000,000 GHc, he will laugh in our face and call us frauds.  If we come back and point a gun to his head and say ""how about now?"",  he will most likely hand over the keys. We call it theft, the west calls it gun boat diplomacy.  That's only part of how the fiat system really works.   Russia has no need of Natural resources from Africa.  They are the Number 1 country in natural resources and rare earth minerals.  What a rising Africa will do is weaken the western European powers. If Ghana and other African countries were to get fair trade deals from Europe, it will have a butterfly effect by increasing the cost of finished goods manufactured in western Europe, which will then drive up inflation, which will then make their products harder to export and compete and finally a dissatisfied populace.   A rising Africa will mean that western Europe has to depend more on next door Russia. So they become less aggressive to Russia due to their dependence on Russia goods. Russia is then able to wield soft power over Europe. Either that or Europe must get expensive resources from the Americans who will eat Europe's manufacturing sector for lunch. The leaves two other alternatives:  1) defeat and colonize Russia and take their resources.  2) Tighten power over the African countries. Aka  ""neocolonialism.""  The second one is more palatable for Europeans.  China wants access to Africa's resources to supplement their already large reserves and as a way to diversify from Australia resources. Western Europe pivoting to Russia will weaken the US hegemony. All good for China.  China does not care  All their care about is african resources and if Africa is willing to trade. A rising Africa is just a cherry on top that will make western europe pivot towards Russia.  Russia doesn't care if African countries are an autocracy, democracy, monarchy, republic, capublic, smopublic. What they want is Africa to pivot away from Europe so themselves can have a soft power over western Europe and control their sphere of influence, just like USA and the Americas.  In conclusion, a rising Africa is  bad for the Western Europe and the USA, but good for Russia and China, not that they truly care, it just happens to help their cause.  The question is what does Ghana want? Does it want to rise? What does Africa want?  Anyway as I was finished typing, I came across this.

GHS = “Ghana Cedi”, and $1 USD was roughly 1.07 GHS in 2007 and is roughly 15 GHS now.   But these notes posted by OP aren’t the current post 2007 Ghana Cedis. These are the previous “New Cedi” which was the currency from 1967-2007.  When the Ghana Cedi was instituted in 2007 it took 10,000 New Cedis to get one Ghana Cedi.   So at the exchange rate now of roughly $1 USD = 15 GHS, you need 150,000 New Cedi to equal 15 Ghana Cedi to equal $1 USD.   Btw of note, the pre coup “Cedi” with Nkrumah’s face took 1.2 to get 1 post 1967 New Cedi without his face, which was worth 10 UK shillings sterling at the time."

Just that regarding the relationship of Nigerians and Ghanaians there is an additional history of political adversity starting with all Ghanaians once being expelled by the Nigerian government.   However, I don't think interafrican racism can be compared to Western forms of racism which often leads to violence and scaring experiences. Nigerians don't have to be afraid of moving around freely among Ghanaians, but they might have difficulties interacting with them."

It's not that she's not interested. They just don't know how to communicate. All you gotta do is take her out and show her a good time and you're in business. It's kinda sad because that's how majority of Ghanaian girls are.

Just lol, lol, lol replies nkoaaa  But lemme be quick to add this, some girls also seem to have dry convos via chats, but when you meet them in person, they’re really lively.

How did you meet? Did the conversation go better then? How long has this been going on? If you’ve been talking for a while, do you always have to start the conversation, or does she sometimes?  Depending on the answers, you can try to continue the conversation, plan to see her in person again, or leave the conversation as is and move on.  Women won’t always give you the vibes you want from them and that’s fine tbh. Just know how to spot this and know when to move on.  Additionally, I think most women just have conversation fatigue lol. For every line you drop, there are 10 other guys — and maybe even women —dropping something similar. Scale that up if she’s super attractive. As much as you think you’re good with lines, if you had to talk to 10 people at the same time, your conversation quality with at least 70% will dip to near-zero."

Even to pay on a first date becomes world war 3. They can be very low effort. Of course I’m not talking about every single person but it’s an observation and I’m not the only one that holds it."

The social class you aim for makes you see girls who can’t hold a conversation as the majority. The social class I aim for makes me see them as minority. I almost never meet a Ghanaian woman who’s not a good conversationalist. When I say dbee I don’t necessarily mean rich (even though that’s what dbee means) I mean intelligent, women with a dadaba mindset, women who crave exposure and are willing to learn. To be able to hold a conversation you have to at least have some level of intellect pertaining to whatever subject and there are A LOT of Ghanaian women who have that. Pleeeeenty. Don’t just follow Adjoa Mansa cuz she’s pretty and has a big botoss expecting her to be good with dialogue. She has nothing to talk about. Personally I only talk to women who are smart and hardworking and I meet them everyday. If you’re not in those categories you’re not my type.  You guys are having difficulty attracting women who can’t hold a convo cuz 1. Social class 2. You don’t know what you want. You don’t know the type of woman you want.  3. You talk to just any woman you think is attractive.  This is not an insult since Ghanaians are terrible at taking criticism but there’s no doubt it isn’t fact. I know this cuz I use to be like you till I upgraded my social class and now I don’t have that problem anymore."

Singles conferences in church? Only women. Messages about how to be a good spouse? Aimed most at women.   I will say that a lot of men aren’t honest about what they want. They say they want godly, modest, homely women as wives but you find they give their energy to the complete opposite women. You want a woman that looks like a baddie but has Mary Mother of God qualities. You want a ho and a housewife. Or you get the godly wife then cheat on her with the women you swear are bad for you."

But in Western countries? Absolutely not. Western culture has normalized female selfishness to the point that most people there can't even recognize it until they're exposed to a different culture. A woman's happiness in Western culture takes top priority even over family and the children. They'll divorce their husband and have their children grow up in a fatherless home over the smallest most frivolous reasons. And the family court will help them do it. Even if it was the woman who cheated. I'm sorry for the rant but it's bad out here. That's why a lot of western-born African men are now looking for wives in their home country rather than dealing with American women.

Whether that is with black men from other countries or non-black men. I feel no ways. People deserve to be loved and treated well, if that comes from someone who doesn’t share the same race as them, why should that matter?

Again, swirling is not an answer for anything. It's never saved us, & it never will. But the worst part, is we don't love each other/ourselves enough to care enough to not want to see ourselves become extinct. We are literally breeding ourselves out of existence.   Those of us who swirl, are not looking for love, they are looking for acceptance.   Not to mention, you mentioned success... Most swirlers see their wealth funneled right into those white (or other non-Black) communities via their non-black partner, rather than their own.

Most don't even respond, even though they have listed their services on Google. Of those that have responded, only very few have actually showed up to do the work. One promised to come later to actually do it, but when I called him on the appointed day, he claimed to be on a trip. Even when I offer to meet them at their workplace, they miss the appointment, and I give up on them.

The reason for that is: Ghana imports more than it exports. Because Ghanaians like foreign stuff more than local stuff and don’t even try to produce something here.  Unfair taxation is caused by the fact that only 7% of Ghanaians pay taxes. Even though everyone would be required by law. So since everyone is acting illegally and the government needs to work anyway, unfair taxes are necessary.  Improper use of resources is also more a business problem and often caused by things like galamsey and generally so called „businesses“ that just exploit the land they are on until it’s destroyed and completely unusable.   Not fully sure what you mean with selling out to colonial powers, but foreign investment is literally the only thing that’s bringing money to the country.

These prices increased due to Natural Gas prices booming as a response to Russian gas being taken off the market, without a corresponding drop in demand. These energy prices fed into other areas of the supply chain corresponding to general inflation increases.  Reducing wasteful government spending is always a good idea, but it’s a misdirection. One can make government more efficient (in billionaire Elon Musk’s case he believes this should be done by REDUCING welfare for millions of normal people). Or one could cut down on tax breaks for the rich, people like Elon Musk, to increase the funds available. Ideally both would be done, but Elon would rather fiscal crisis have the average person pay, than him.   And I think this is incapsulated by how he frames inflation/his conservative stance.  Musk is an opportunist desperate to stay relevant by beating the right wing conspiracy drum in my opinion. I assume he’s looking to help Trump win, in order to cash out on his support politically.   That people find him relatable is bizarre, but I guess he does try pretty hard to cosplay as politically normal."

It's basic economics. The government does not make money. All it does is to go to the central bank, borrows money in exchange for bonds and spends it on whatever policy or project. The loan from the bank is paid by adjusting the nation's fiscal policy or the purchase of bonds by individuals.  A basic fact (one of the first things you learn) in macroeconomics is that, printing money increases inflation because it reduces the purchasing power of the currency because of its abundance in the system. If anyone says it's because of corporate greed, that person is being delusional because if one company increases its prices, we will all switch to substitutes. If all companies increase prices, it's a reflection of the economic situation caused by the government"

They think everybody can just shake hands and all we will be kumbaya night and day.  The most fundamental driving force of inflation is the loss in value of money. What courses loss in value of money? The increasing supply of money. Yes, ""leftist,"" it's the increasing supply of money coupled with no demand for said money.   Ghana's government isn't generating enough revenue, the demand for the cedi is low compared to the demand for the USD. Unlike USA, Ghana doesn't have many ""Elon Musk"" who create impactful products.   As a result, Ghana is faced with two options,  1) print money.  2) borrow money.   Elon Musk and he's rich cohorts create products that drive the economy. Without people like Elon Musk, the economy will collapse. That's why Sub-Saharan Africa remains stagnant(Although, it's not a straight forward problem, but you get the point).  Thus, to motivate the Elon Muskes to remain productive, after all they fetch in the $$$, government offer stimulus packages, turns a blind eye to their tax evasion tricks.   Plus, Tax evasion is a trick any body can play. We are mostly just not educated enough or don't have enough resources to play at the level of Billionaires. Billionaires don't receive salaries and have assets locked away in unrealized assets. Government could tax these assets but, it creates an entirely different problem.  To ""thank"" the government for turning a blind eye and offering stimulus packages, billionaires employ lots of people. The people are happy, the government is happy, and the billionaires are happy. America has been able to maintain it's inflation rate for a long long time. Except in the turn of unsuspected events or disasters.   Japan, China, Europe, all follow the same fomular. And are doing great.   So, in a sense, Elon is right! America spends alot. They hate Donald Trump but Donald Trump complained that America was giving too much stimulus package to international bodies like UN et all.,   Now, America is funding the war in Ukraine and Isreal-Gaza.

I am pointing out that saying « your tax dollars should be spent well, not poorly » in this context could be seen as proposing that government spending tax money is somehow inflationary which is false.  No, it does not all trace back to government spending. Shocks do exist, as I said. Otherwise, no serious government in the world would ever have to deal with unexpected inflation! So sweeping all inflation under the government bad argument is also disingenuous in my opinion. In the case of Ghana, after a quick search, it seems like the inflation might be due to various supply shocks during the pandemic causing a depletion of foreign currency reserves and a depreciation of the cedi, making imports more expensive. How is that (so far) related to governmental borrowing at all?  Also, other forms of borrowings from the government exist, that are not just borrowing from the central bank (private sector, public sector, etc.)  Yes, when the central bank prints money, inflation happens, all else being equal. Yes, if the central bank is reckless with this, too much inflation occurs. However, quantitative easing is supposed to be a last resort measure (especially after interest rates have been dropped to near 0) and does not occur as often as people think it does. The central bank is supposed to be an independent body from the government to avoid this conflict of interest in the first place. The government doesn’t just order the central bank to print more money, quantitative easing is a tool that the central bank to reach its targets. In the US, you can look at the Fed’s balance sheet and you’ll find that it only increased in response to recessions, and yes it caused inflation but that was more like an intended evil to be able to get the country back on track rather than some conspiracy from the government to keep spending more forever!  You might want to argue that (1) a specific central bank is not really independent from its executive body or (2) a specific government is incompetent and forces the central bank to bail it out from its bad decisions.

There is a gift exemption available to both individuals in a married couple, which has a strict limit, and the trust is simply used to lock in a rate such that appreciating assets may slightly surpass this limit. Keyword being slightly, especially when accounting for inflation. These exemptions are of an amount that would be irrelevant to the billionaires we're discussing, albeit highly useful to many lower end 1%ers.   20% tax on gains, by the way, is an additional tax to the up to 70% income taxes and varying sales taxes. Whatever gains they make have the direct 20 cut and the indirect 40-70 cut, as well as inevitably standard sales/purchasing taxes when spent. And things like taxes on property ownership, which can easily wipe out any asset appreciation for those with heavy real estate portfolios - but, of course, even if you're in the negative with these taxes, you'll still be on the hook for ""Gains"" taxes."

He enjoys all the incentives the US govt grants his companies and products (Huge tariffs on Chinese EVs after his truck got bad reviews and other consumers wanted to scope out the competition). The same guy who tried to strong arm the state his company is in and threatened to take his company to another state because of legislation that doesn’t align with his views.

Carbohydrates converts to sugar, and if not burnt off, can cause problems over time. Replacing fufu with rice or anything starchy foods solves nothing.  If anything, fufu is better because it still retains all the fiber.   According to unicef report, our children are passing English (BECE)at 37% rate. This means the vast majority of the population achieve basic level of formal education and that is one of the major reason we are at a standstill. Fufu (or diet) isn’t gonna make the top 10 list of our issues.   > Basic Education Certification Exam (BECE) exam performance across subjects is low, but it is particularly poor in English. The national average is below 50 per cent in both English and mathematics and has consistently remained at this level over the past four years. **Students underperform in English, scoring a low average of 37 per cent**. The national averages also mask significant regional variations.  https://www.unicef.org/innocenti/media/3011/file/UNICEF-DMS-Ghana-Policy-Brief-1-2023.pdf"

Both sources lead to pages that you need to subscriptions to read and don’t seem to bring up fufu. Imma need you to provide SOLID evidence as someone else has against your point  2. “Less Juju in our movies”. A bible thumping Christian. Why am I not surprised?  3. Explain your manual labourers point real quick  4. “Fufu being the Chinas wall to progress”. Be serious. There are SO many problems to Ghanas progress and you want to try and blame it all on Fufu, a food that has existed longer than any of Ghanas current problems?  5. That afternoon slump isn’t new. Here in the West after about 2, people need coffee just to keep going. It’s called the mid afternoon slump. You can google what that is when you are done  6. Children sleeping schools is nothing new either. It’s a mix of several factors. And the level of school you are talking about is telling. If it’s anything equivalent to upper level Secondary to Sixth Form and above in the UK, sleep and homework might be the greater reasons, alongside some finding the academic side of school boring and tiresome (I myself was more attune to Vocational subjects in school, although History was and still is a favourite)  Simply put, whilst fufu is definitely on the starchy side of food and overeating it is not good for you (like most things in life) (I asked you to elaborate on the history of the food because if you know the history of the food, it would be important here), here in the West we mainly have fast food. I don’t care how much of it you want to eat, fast food is definitely worse, yet we still are better here in the West. Saying Fufu is the biggest obstacle to Ghanas progress is outta touch, flat out wrong and would have me asking what is wrong with you? What about all of the leaders since the British left? What about the allowing of resources to be exploited?"

A nation’s development highly depends on the unity, thought process, attitude towards nation building and how the citizens basically see themselves compared to other nations.   I have lived in South Korea and Germany for a span of 10 years. South Koreans eat rice or ramen noodles with their foods for breakfast, lunch, dinner and even late night dinners. They also drink heavily (soju,beer(mekchu) or mixture of both) sometimes during lunch and almost always during dinner. This never negatively impacted the work culture of Koreans. In fact they have one of the most rigorous work ethics and their economy is a proof of that.   Germans eat potatoes (starchy food) and drink beer for dinner almost every single day. This never impacted their economy or work ethic. In fact it’s one of the richest countries in the world.   While food may impact the health of a population it certainly does not negatively impact a country’s economical progress.   OP wei de3 just tell us you hate fufu and let’s close the case wai."

My compliments to the OP. However humorous, he's actually got a point. Not just starchy foods, but all simple carbohydrates, especially when eaten in excess, are detrimental, not only to our productivity, but overall health as well. When you eat so much and move or exercise so little, you become fat, and you become a burden to the healthcare system, while setting yourself up for an early death. Look at the skyrocketing levels of obesity in this country. The gluttony is unbecoming of us. Give people a little bit of money and they just keep stuffing their faces until the money is finished. A well balanced, nutrient dense combination of modest amounts of complex carbohydrates, quality sources of protein, healthy fats and fibres are better than these carb bombs full of empty calories... And yes, the foods we eat do have a profound effect on our mental state and intellectual development as well."

How dare you complain bout someone eating fufu for lunch and being unproductive .? Who lied to you on that analysis ? You talked of boiled Plantain (carbo and starch) and kontomire, so what you talmbout? Our great grandparents ate greens, fufu, bush meat, kenkey, banku etc and still were able to live over 100 years!

I was wondering if the restaurant mixed something in the food and that's how I landed here.   Good to know. As a south Indian all our meals consist of white rice traditionally. And we are known to take afternoon naps because it's so hot too. Lately my people have been trying to avoid white rice for the same reason. Glucose spike, drowsiness, weight gain, insulin resistance and diabetes. I do think we should change our diets based on our lifestyle and activity level, EVEN if our ancestors always ate the same food and lived long lives."

And during my research I came to find out that jolof rice isn’t really a native West African dish. Tomatoes were brought over from the Western Europeans who had been introduced to it by the Native Americans. Once we ourselves were introduced to tomatoes, it became a main ingredient in most our dishes. All this just to say we don’t need to keep doing something because of culture or tradition, rather we should do it because of science and how it’ll benefit us and our lineages. We don’t have to get rid of heavy starches entirely because we’re not animals and we have enough self control and awareness to do portion control. I still eat a lot of food from home but now there’s always vegetables on my plate or in my bowl."

I hope we can all agree that sleeping in class,  whether in Ghana or England or China, isn't great. What I'm about to say applies to everyone but I'll just focus on school children because that's what my original comment was about.    What are some reasons that kids sleep in class? Maybe they didnt get sleep the night before; homeless, bad living situations, having to work all night, illness, injury. I'm sure there are other reasons, but for the most part, the reasons that kids sleep in class is because something in their life isn't going great.    The issues that lead to sleeping in class have been studied and we *know* as a society that these things hinder learning outcomes. It's not even debatable anymore. We *know* kids who don't sleep enough can't learn well.    There have been countless initiatives all over the world, government and NGO, that try to bring healthy food to schools because, again, we *know* healthy food is super important for school children. We *know* the food they eat matters.    And if it's culturally recognized in Ghana that heavy food makes people foggy and sleepy, why would we keep doing that? If we *know* banku is going to make these kids sleep in class, then *why* on earth is it still happening?   We know: 1) heavy, starchy food makes people sleepy/foggy AND 2) sleeping in class leads to poor learning outcomes.    So why would we let kids continue to eat food that makes them fall asleep in class, knowing that the very act of falling asleep is what prevents them from learning? "

Regarding carbs, the body can utilize energy from carbs faster than energy from fats so both types are important depending on your lifestyle.

Boy T1 Diabetes helps you learn about this fast. Also being more nutrient dense, has a higher calorie count), and what I’m getting is that it isn’t fufu itself to an extent. It’s the overeating, which is something that will lead to every one of said problems regardless of the starch  It also speaks to the fact that kids aren’t getting out enough to burn them carbs. It’s why the OG commenter doesn’t talk about the younger kids.

Even in the mature democracies we look up to, power shifts primarily between two parties.   What we have always needed are stronger and more independent public institutions. Institutions that can hold the government accountable or reduce the sweeping power that the president holds. Our head of state is too powerful. Imagine appointing everyone down to the District assembly level. We cannot develop if our district assembly is merely an ineffective rubber stamp. In other countries we admire, government at the local level is taken very seriously, and often selected outside appointments by the president.   Again there are yet other institutions, including for example the office of budget responsibility in the UK, which seeks to ensure proposed budgets are financially responsible. This office is non-partisan. And Governments ignore their prescriptions at their own peril. Ask the failed UK PM Liz Truss how this office set the tone for her swift exit following proposed tax cuts deemed irresponsible.   So stronger institutions are what we really need. Ideally, we should get to a point where it doesn't matter too much who the head of state is or which party they are from."

It totally ignores history and the socio economic landscape of Ghana.   3rd parties can thrive in countries where there are deep ethnic divides. Buhari became President in Nigeria with a third party. This is possible in a country where there are large distinct  groups who can join and form a large enough party. Ghana has no groups large enough to join and compete. In Nigeria, there are the Yorubas, Hausas, Igbo and smaller ones. Any 2 or 3 can amalgamate to be formidable.  In Ghana even the Asante region cannot go it alone. 3rd parties are common for example,  the Balkan countries which were split into factions by strife.   Ghana's 2 parties have thrived since 1957. The UK has parties formed centuries ago and which retain their ideology.   Finally all ideas are dualistic. Every other idea is in between the 2 extremes.   2 party systems represent political duality  Yes/ No.     Hot/Cold  Wise/Foolish,      socialism / capitalism.    Conservative/progressive  It is difficult to come up with any independent idea ."

It’s def true that Ghana lacks the kind of ethnic coalitions seen in Nigeria, but growing dissatisfaction with the status quo, particularly among younger voters, highlights an ideological gap.   Talking about the dualistic nature of political ideas, let’s be honest, even the political insiders on both sides struggle to distinguish the ideological positions of the two parties, which indicates space for fresh political alternatives. Both major parties consistently converge on similar policy approaches, leaving issues like corruption, youth unemployment, and regional inequalities insufficiently addressed.  Globally, we’ve seen how third parties thrive when they focus on neglected issues or represent disenfranchised groups—Canada’s NDP or India’s regional parties are examples. In Ghana, a third party could succeed by mobilizing grassroots support, leveraging digital platforms to engage youth, and prioritizing clear, issue-based campaigns. This new force guy coming in 3rd place is nothing to shake a stick at. My only advice to him is that a third party, especially at its inception, shouldn’t seek to dismantle the dualistic system but rather reframe it, offering voters a meaningful alternative. The challenges will be significant, but so are the opportunities."

They involve basic knowledge, spatial, and conceptual appreciations.  IQ  tests  and other cognitive tests are conducted frequently by international educational bodies  annually in all UNESCO member countries. It is unlikely that anyone not involved in international education or the educational ministry will be aware of it.    Your child probably took the test but you were not aware.  They might have told you,     ""Dad/Mum, we did a test in school today, our teacher said it will not count "" etc.   Anyone who is interested can Google and find historical data of IQ years for all countries  going back several decades.   Instead of finding  out about the methodology, I am surprised that many contributors are assuming a knee jerk reaction about it  and claiming that the odds are  stacked against  Africans.   This is not a viable way to develop approaches to improve because it has nothing to do with  genetics but rather it is about sufficient exposure. The scores  generally indicate the different levels of educational and experiential content and language comprehension  for usually age 14  (8th grade) which in Ghana is around JSS.  LANGUAGE   The tests are  in the main official languages which for Ghanaians will be English. By the nature, of  our educational system pupils  lack the language skills of countries who use it as their mother tongue. Even if it were done in  Akan, Ga , Ewe etc language, it is unlikely they will be able to express some  concepts in them.   Even the use of words/ phrases like   distinguish between,  average, express,  sum of, product,  mean, integer, polygon,    are used freely and may not be easily appreciated by our JSS students. In that sense , they may  not achieve the expected grade merely because  they are not used to the words.  Suggesting  the use of the local language is not feasible.  There are probably people here who have not even read a book in their first language not to talk about JSS pupils.  Moreover, 90 % of our first language is learned orally. It is not anyone's fault.   Culture  There was an attempt by an African educationalist to make an African friendly test,  which European pupils got   wrong. e.g.  How babies are carried.    ( on the back)  Where we sleep.    (  on a Mat )  How to carry load. (  On the head ).   Experiential  There are questions included in the test which are easy to answer if pupils play with different types of toys, or have been  involved in different games etc. Such experiences help in questions that require spatial, and conceptual thought.  E.g. which will fit in a hoop ?  a rod,  a box  or   a   cantaloupe?   Playing  A few minutes browsing TikTok will show how our children occupy themselves compared to  how Chinese and European pupils occupy themselves. Children are raised to develop hobbies, building and, creating  things, piano, guitar, assembling engines, and handling objects etc.   These are some of the reasons why  different outcomes are observed. Without doubt all humans have similar abilities so if  our pupils' are expected to achieve at high levels their life experiences should be  more directed towards more learning in school and on their own.   Africans clearly do not do well in tennis. The reaction to this fact is not to claim that  tennis is a useless game, or it is a racist game. There are identifiable reasons why we achieve differently in the game."

I’m a member of British Mensa, I have a 99th percentile IQ, my dad and my children would likely make the cut too. I come from a poor village near Ho where during the 80s over ten people won scholarships to study at MIT, Harvard etc in America, mainly to study engineering or physics. We are children and grandchildren of subsistence farmers and nobody came from any privilege.  IQ measures a certain aspect of human intelligence. It can be hereditary but also taught and practised. Depending on how people solve problems you exercise that aspect of the brain to good effect. It is not something to use to make others feel small but it also carries value and is well represented among our communities. Education boosts IQ over generations as certain studies show.  There is a western bias I would say, albeit that has been sought to be eliminated by using tests which are ‘culture neutral’. Also, given how westernised our society has been for at least 50 years it would be arguable that any western bias is somewhat diminishing.  Overall I question the source and methods of these claims."

I say this as someone who’s read a lot about IQ and race. There are multiple problems with IQ tests, but they are just an approximation of cognitive ability within a population. What determines a 100 is the average score and the test a specific type of g-loaded intelligence. A good example to illustrate this is the Flynn effect, average absolute IQ scores today in most western countries are much higher than westerners 50-100 years ago. Does that mean those people were dumb? No. IQ also tests for a specific type of intelligence, and is affected by introduction to western type education <- IQ tests do not control for culture bias, access to food, shelter, poverty, being exposed to similar questions/problems/type of thinking, etc. IQ tests do not control for this, some IQ tests aren’t even done in people’s host languages in these studies. This is why when you see countries develop, their IQ scores magically increase along with it. In addition, if we were to take  at face value that Ghana has an IQ score of 70, based on IQ tests, the standard deviation of African IQ tends to be lower, so there’s a greater cluster around the mean. There should be no major Ghanaian scientists or experts in any field. Yet Ghanaians in UK outperform their white peers. That would mean those Ghanaians in the UK for example would be at the bare minimum averaging around 4 standard deviations away from the mean. They would be representing 0.003% of the population.  That’s statistically impossible even if the UK had the best selection system to select only the brightest Ghanaians and their children. To give you how absurd that would be, given Ghana’s population, the top 1000 Ghanaians would average the average IQ of a white person, meanwhile in the UK there are way more than a 1000 Ghanaian students and they are outperforming them on every metric. Same in the United States, African students, Ghanaian and Nigerian and others are over represented in the highest institutions. <- this statistically reality actually implies that given the same material, economic and environmental conditions, the average Ghanaian and Nigerian is smarter than the average white person in terms of IQ.  If you’re interested there are several articles on race and iq I can send you that discuss this topic."

If only post-SHS students pass the tests, the range should be 50-70.   I can guarantee you scoring even 70 is not a common thing within Africa.  98% of the African population isn't 'university level.'  Test scores for 98% of Africans, particularly those who didn't pursue higher education, would typically be below 30.  In rural areas, well below that score even if the test was entirely written in the local language.

These general iq tests aren’t done through any form of proper measurement. They typically look at factors like the jobs their specific subjects perform. It is thought that people who perform white collar jobs have a higher iq than those who work blue collar or in any other sector. For example the iq required to be a farmer is thought to be much less than that required for a chartered accountant. And since our population doesn’t really have a lot of white collar jobs they take the presumed mean iq based on the jobs and report it. All of this iq talk is just a bunch of race science and eugenics. There isn’t any sure way to measure intelligence. If anything iq would be a measure of aptitude rather than intelligence.

Now you want to seriously complain if European countries apply their own cultural standards to everyone including migrants? Seriously? Explain to me again please the benefits I can expect as a migrant going the other way.   Those who decide to live in Europe better respect the rules and the culture and adapt as much as I have to. They can always go back to their culture if they dislike it there. ""Go back to your country"". I have heard it here too often when the squatters seriously tell me the road in front of my compound is for them and I should stay inside.   Interesting is your not uncommon separation of ""Whites"" and ""Westerners"". But really, do you believe, the Chinese have special procedures for the handful of African students there? Or try Moscow my friend.   I have to assume, that you are using this subject as just another opportunity to make your point, i. e. inadequate propaganda. But it doesn't belong here."

The only way to sustainably raise wages is to help the private sector grow and become more productive.  Simply increasing the minimum wage won't magically make businesses more productive or workers wealthier. If it were as easy as setting a higher minimum wage, every country could have a high wage economy.  It's disheartening how little some people understand about how a modern economy functions. The knowledge is readily available these days, so there's no excuse for many of these comments."

However, after a 3 years, we implemented enough cross-checking that thefts are caught within the first month. Also, the cadre of people who are vetted as non-theives continues to grow. Right now we're 100% no thieves, but we're still hiring so the next people might be thieves... but we'll sort through them and keep the the honest.  We pay bump on a yearly inflation cycle, so that means 20% extra per year minimum.  My issue isn't theft, not really. It's finding people with good qualifications, and people who are determined to learn and work.  I don't see this as a Ghana issue though.

If you agree with an employer to take anything above the minimum wage as salary, then you can not come back and say the salary is too small, so I am going to steal from him. That's dishonesty at the highest level!  Some government agencies (YEA) are paying employees well below the minimum wage - 250 cedis pm  I don't blame the employer, I blame the government.

The truth of the matter, however , is it is not ethical to steal from your employer because you are underpaid.  You were not forced at gunpoint to work for him. Either go find something that pays better or go start your own business so you can pay yourself what you think you deserve."

Your bolt driver could have cautioned you not to use your phone by the window. Accra is mostly safe but this kind of theft cases do happen in certain areas, and it's not like Accra is the only place you might experience this.  Oh and thinking of not coming back to Accra anytime soon doesn't mean the next time you come and use your phone by the window, the snatchers will not want to offend you cos you'll leave and not come back anytime soon.  Inquire about life here in Accra and the best practices that will keep you safe, you'll be fine.  Permit me to share: When I visited Kumasi, I always called my friend who's based in Kumasi and inquired about the places where I wanted to go and ask for advice before stepping out of my room.  Your ""personal"" security is your responsibility, so make it a priority.  Stay safe."

My phone was pick pocketed last month, as I was trying to board a trotro at Spanner during rush hour. Normally I am vigilant and aware of my phone and wallet in my pocket in crowded places, but as everyone was jockeying to get a place on the trotro, some guy kept pushing me hard from behind, on my right side. Then before I knew it, someone had snatched my phone from my left pocket. I noticed almost immediately, but there were just too many people around to know who did it... Extremely annoying, especially since I had taken such good care of my phone... These things have been going on for years, but I feel that crime has gone up a lot more recently. I actually had to install a security camera at my place, only to find a guy literally trying to steal the camera straight off the wall... I chased him down with a bat, but he was running for his life so he managed to outrun me... All my neighbors have had to deal with theft and even break ins as well... And online, a lot of people will actually defend thieves or show more sympathy to them than their victims... These days, crime is often admired, excused or ignored. Societal decay... The country is in a mess... Just look at some of the replies in to this thread, gaslighting the victim for ""not being vigilant enough""... These things happen to even the most vigilant among us. Many of these thieves are professionals. Not simply opportunistic thieves... They have perfected their putrid art..."

Both happened while I was driving in traffic with my windows down. First at circle, then Airport (Opeibea). I've also seen it happen to others a few times. They even have a way of distracting you on the left side of the car while their partner snatches it from the right. So now when I'm driving, no matter the location, I'm always mindful and I keep my windows fully rolled up or just 2 or 3 inches down. I'm also more cautious when there's someone else in the car cos I feel like I have a duty to protect them after what I experienced. Phone snatching is prevalent now and it's not only in traffic. Your phone can also be pulled out of your pocket if you're in a crowded area such as when you're trying to enter a club or the stadium for a show. Those of us in town already know this yet we still fall victim sometimes. It's very unfortunate but you have to be vigilant always."

But if you come to a place where some people have to do anything and everything possible to survive the day due to a not so great economy, you have got to be extra vigilant about phone snatchers, burglars, thieves and then some.  I haven’t personally experienced this again since someone snatched my GameBoy when i was much younger, but listening to other people who have been victims and from videos online, i know to be extra cautious.  If you’d use your phone in the bolt, roll up your windows more than halfway. Yeah, the weather is warm and it’s going to get uncomfortable but it’s better to sweat than lose your phone.

In USA if you saw a large AA man with a mean look, you might be worried.  In Ghana, they do not try to intimidate you or bully you.  In fact both the men and women are kind.  I never had 1 altercation with any Ghana citizen.   The men were hitting on my Ivory Coast gf but if they saw me they would apologize.  They mostly call me boss or sir and always say God bless you.     The women are slow compared to the rest of the world.  Meaning they date later and in general become women in the mid to late twenties.  Yet you will never see more naturally fit women as a country than in ghana.  Most don't realize how much in demand they would be in other countries.    They all are willing to cook and clean....but so are the men there.  Remember this is a country where the haves give the have nots scraps.  Although everyone is employed.  You can go to a restaurant and they have twice the number of workers than what they need.   Even with this the people are generally in a good mood.    The weirdest thing is the real estate prices.  Labor and materials are low, but rent is high.   That is the lack of a financial system to loan money so developers have to use cash and must get their returns in a few years and not a long term payment schedule.  This raises rent and it is almost triple what it should be for the same costs in USA.    RENT is based on costs of buildings and not their actual value but not in ghana, it is based on total cost of building but not just 20% more than owners mortgage payment.   It's based on owner paying off entire building in 5 years or less.  This makes living difficult there.    Cars are what confuse me there.  Many have them and there is a lot of traffic.  I didn't expect so many cars or traffic.  My next trip i will try to figure that out.  Be there in a month."

Sounds, shadows, anything make me get ready.  This Ghana ""training"" safed me at least twice from attempted robberies, once in Brazil and once in Morocco.

I've been here quite long enough too(in fact, over 30 years ) and witnessed first-hand experiences of how some of these thefts go down. Sometimes, after they've stolen from you and you sit down and try to re-trace your steps to find out how they even managed to do it in the first place, you simply can't help but raise your hands in humble admission of the ""brain"" behind the tactics they employed. There are other times, where they operate in a team, where they send someone as a decoy to engage you in an interesting conversation of some sort and while you're engrossed in the conversation , the other one sneaks right behind you to loot you. It makes you wonder why they don't use such ""knowledge"" for positive ventures. Like it or not, while these guys may be thieves, thugs etc and their actions are despicable to say the least,  what you cannot take away from them is the sheer ingenuity (hurts me to say this btw) they employ in their operations sometimes.  It's funny - you say you've developed a sixth sense eh, just pray you don't meet a thief with a SEVENTH sense - Then you will know this is really Ghana INDEED. For the record, I never misquoted you. Go back and read your initial post. You were clear as crystal in laying all the blame at the doorstep of the victim which I found very insensitive."

The world recognizes the benefits of visa free travel. You saw the  European countries did it. You saw the Caribbean countries did it creating their Caribbean passport. You hear Trump talking about making Canada the 51st state. Australia/New Zealand. The Nordic countries. You see where the world is going. Somehow “They” have convinced you that it’s good for “Them” but bad for you. Free your mind brother. There always will be negatives. But focus on the positives. Unite and become powerful. The first step of getting rid of the governments is getting rid of the borders. They not even talking about open borders. They talking about visa free travel. A minor step forward. Embrace it. When the individual countries in Africa sit at the table. It’s like a joke. There is no power. If a united Africa goes to the table then there will be power. We many years away from that but I’m so happy Ghana has taken this first small step. Free Africa. Free our Minds. God Bless

And since 1957 Ghana hasn't had problems with Europeans not leaving.  Why don't I recommend friends and business partners visit Ghana? Because the visa process is so difficult that it ends up being extremely expensive.  I have used at least 30.000 Ghana cedis to get 4 visas. All because of a bureaucratic system that works well when you can bribe someone for minor mistakes, but totally collapses in other countries when bribe is not possible.

And I say this from experience. I haven’t had to go through any hassle yet traveling to other countries. Almost all European countries have these arrangements too. Most countries has its own list of visa-free destinations and maximum stay periods so Ghana adopting the same policy for African countries is not unusual, provided that arrangements are made to mitigate against overstaying.   And, an example, an American citizen cannot start a business in Portugal while on “vacay” without the proper visa or citizenship. There is a process they must follow. The same applies to Australia and many other countries you name it. These countries citizens won’t have to be worried about foreigners “taking their jobs”.  If Ghana follows this approach citizens wouldn’t have to worry about that but I definitely understand the concerns due to lack of structure in Ghana.   The downside is the inflated prices though. The average citizen won’t be able to afford certain goods & services. But that comes with vacation destinations. And tbh, from my experience, they are reasonable prices and have seen locals enjoy the services I enjoy too. Ghana on the other hand, knows no limit."

And alot of our trash is dumped in 3rd world countries. So the west is not efficient in recycling or even waste control, we just make it another countries' issue. The process of recycling is a long and expensive process and a lot of recyclables are not actually recyclable. In the US only about 10% of recyclables actually get recycled.   For example in this case these containers are contaminated therefore would take a lot of resources such as water, electricity and manpower to clean and recycle. The best alternative may be to have reusable containers or invest in containers that are actually recyclable or degradable which would be expensive. In addition to that there'd have to be a recycling company in the area that is actually recycling waste correctly and efficiently and willing to pick up the recycling. My point is a solution exists but it's gonna be hard to find especially one that's within the scope of a single restaurant.  I'd say the East Asian recycling system is actually the most efficient, largely do to the fact the citizens do half the work of cleaning and sorting their own recycling: https://youtu.be/WB-yxJNf-pE?si=-fgxWE8dbdCoYGtm  Here's some refs for the other things I spoke about: https://youtu.be/iBGZtNJAt-M?si=zSMfHdyZTp9FSRbK  https://youtu.be/PJnJ8mK3Q3g?si=zvN_bVvTTuKwFRIc  https://youtu.be/ZBQPks1zb3A?si=rerk4PCGAWIYp45L"

I used to sell fitness articles on there (X)but its saturated, think the guys selling subscriptions on dealing with women are doing well now.  You should go down the training course route..with your track record. You can either write articles and sell them or develop a course to sell."

I’m a freelance Digital Marketer myself and I’ve had quite some success pushing about $5K Monthly. I want to go into YouTube content creation with AI.   Would you be open to recommending some tools and niches to me?   I’d appreciate that.

I use free tools .  1. Meta.ai for pictures( free)  .AI pictures .  For videos I use pexel/ pixbay ..Chat Gpt for voice overs .   You could check out the New Google Notebook AI  feature.( voice over discussions)    The Ai discussion voice over is something else.   Use canva which is free for your youtube  thumbnails.  There are also ways to create animations with canva on yourube for kids ( very lucrative area.)   As Mr beast said ( youtuber ) you have not done anything untill you post your first 100 videos .....the secret to youtube success is to keep posting  consistently even then you think no one is watching .  That's something all the big youtubers with millions of followers stress on .. the thing about youtube a video you posted over a years ago can earn you money even 5 years later...

I want the Npp out but to be honest I'll be pleasantly surprised if the NDC actually does good this time around. they are two sides of the same coin

The demonstration isn’t necessary, the miners and leaders are on the same page.  The right thing to do is elect the right leaders.  NPP/NDC is our problem as Ghanaians.  Once we have a country where the personal interests and that of their political parties are put before citizens we will forever suffer."
