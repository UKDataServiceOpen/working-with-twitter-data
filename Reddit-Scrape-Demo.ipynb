    "In this notebook we detail the recommended way to collect large amounts of Reddit data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Previously we recommended Twitter/X as a fantastic source of social media textual data. Sadly, that's no longer the case.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Reddit API is a close approvimation, though markedly more complicated. Where a tweet stands on it's own contextless, most Reddit comments are related to the post title, or previous comments in a thread in some way and carry a more inherent bias in that regard.\n",
    "\n",
    "The good news, the Reddit API is free. We can get roughly 100 comments per request × 60 requests = ~6,000 comments/minute. With clever programming we can theoretically grab all comments from a subreddit.\n",
    "\n",
    "The best package for reddit-scraping is the Python Reddit API Wrapper, or [PRAW](https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/installation.html)."

      "Oh, that's good to know! Are the drinks expensive there?\n",
      "Thank you very much! Much appreciate! If anything else comes to your mind please share more info with me :)\n",
      "Personal taxi driver? What do you mean? They are different than normal taxis? I can't use buses?\n",
      "I was thinking August or September. A week or 2 weeks max\n",
      "First of all. Russia fight with Ukraine. Not Poland. We help them a lot. The most out of all countries. But we can't actively fight. Unless you want a World War  3 that is. Second, don't expect us all to go to war. I'm not a soldier\n",
      "What month were you there?\n",
      "😅 it sure was memorable.\n",
      "Hey, I’m looking to travel from Canada to Ghana as a USA citizen. What airport did you travel from? Also I just found out about the baggage issues and strike. Which airport do you suggest I travel from in Canada?\n",
      "Yep... The temperature can be a bit humid and you definitely don't want to be musty in Ghana. \n",
      "The spiciness of the food can be adjusted at your request.\n",
      "A pair of sturdy boots for when you're off road and a pair of comfortable sandals (Birkenstocks or any of that design) for the casual outings. \n",
      "You can buy very cheap bathroom sandals when you arrive for lounging around the house.\n",
      "drinks are expensive at certain establishments\n",
      "Hey, I'm just looking at some ideas on a trip to Ghana and found this helpful comment you replied to.... Did you ever end up going to Ghana?\n",
      "Sure thing! Welcome.😊\n",
      "What i mean is if you find a taxi driver that you like get their number so that you can always call them. You can use buses but please do not use the smaller vans even though they are much cheaper they are very unsafe.\n",
      "then the top comment is just fine. get a couple sneakers (air forces will be good) and then some birkenstocks for when it gets too hot or when wearing a shoe gets uncomfortable. the heat is pretty high and random. \n",
      "\n",
      "AND WATCH WHAT YOU EAT. this the most important one😅\n",
      "August, which i believe is their \"winter\", lol.\n",
      "Hhahaha the only downside. I loved it!!!\n",
      "I left from Europe, sorry.\n",

      "\n",
      "Expensive places in Accra will generally feel like it's worth it. Except Kōzo Restaurant (Japanese). That place is overpriced. Their drinks are watery. Their portions are small. Their menu is mediocre, and they seem to think seasoning is the salt and pepper you should add yourself at the table. Don't go there. Seriously. $200 a person for total BS.\n",
      "Hi, not yet. We will see, maybe this year\n",
      "Oh, ok. Good to know! Thanks\n",
      "What do you mean with the food?\n",
      "there’s some food out here that would mess up your stomach badly. it’s good food tho, but it’ll take a long time to get used to it. id advice you to eat food that’s similar to what you eat in Polan for a while\n"
