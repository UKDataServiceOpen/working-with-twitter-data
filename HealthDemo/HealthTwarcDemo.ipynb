    "In this notebook we detail my recommended route to collecting Twitter Archive data. Through the usual free, or professional API tiers you can only access at most the last 30 days of Twitter data. This is adequate if you want to start collecting and curating a Twitter dataset, but largely useless if you want to look at the history of Twitter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Twitters archive search was released as part of Twitter's V2 API in August 2020, as such it's relatively new and largely unsupported by open source packages.\n",
    "Twitters documentation, and community tutorials have also changed a lot in this time.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few packages that can play with this V2 API, but my personal recommendation is [Twarc](https://github.com/DocNow/twarc). There are also a few plugins we can use to convert the output into a CSV file, and various other helpers.\n",
    "\n",
    "This package is a little weird as it runs as a command-line tool. It can be used as a Python package but in this regard the documentation is less clear currently.\n",
    "As this is a command-line tool, it's a little tricky to demo so most code cells here will exist to be copied into the terminal, and details for that installation are outlined.\n"
