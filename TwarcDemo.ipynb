    "# Case Study - London Veganuary 2019\n",
    "It's not enough that we simply search all tweets, in fact we will very quickly hit our 10,000,000 tweet limit with this approach, adding a one month delay to our research.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How useful is 10,000,000 tweets?\n",
    "From my previous attempts at this collecting all tweets containing the word vegan in January 2019 returned 1.2 million tweets. This took 32 hours and resulted in a 4.2GB file.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are an estimated 500 million tweets uploaded every day.\n",
    "As such it's important to narrow the scope of your project, and focus on very specific time periods.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The query\n",
    "We are asking \"How did the vegan perception change over Veganuary 2019\" This was the first largely adopted veganuary, famously the announcment of Greggs sausage rolls. We need to get only tweets from this period, near London, and we are not interested in collecting any Retweets or replies.\n",
    "\n",
    "we need the following data:\n",
    "* tweet ID\n",
    "* tweet text\n",
    "* user names and IDs\n",
    "* Anything that will help us check locations\n",
    "* the number of retweets and favorites on each tweet\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's build this up piece by piece\n",
    "\n",
    "### Custom search term\n",
    "We simply write the term we are searching for, \"vegan\", after the search keyword.\n",
    "WARNING - DO NOT RUN THESE WITHOUT --limit\n",
    "```\n",
    "twarc2 search vegan vegan.jsonl\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "what about vegatarians? What about plant-based diets? For multiple terms we wrap the search in quotes. We can also OR, AND and use other operators to specify what we want.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "twarc2 search \"vegan OR vegetarian OR plant-based\" vegan.jsonl\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limit the search\n",
    "Unless you want to capture all tweets that match this search, you should limit your search. adding `--limit x` replacing x with the number of tweets you want will help you here. \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "twarc2 search --limit 100 \"vegan OR vegetarian OR plant-based\" vegan.jsonl\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Archive search\n",
    "The `--archive` flag lets Twitter know we want to access more than the last 7 days. You will only be allowed to do this with the academic tier, it won't fail otherwise it will just give you recent tweets instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "twarc2 search --archive --limit 100 \"vegan OR vegetarian OR plant-based\" vegan.jsonl\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Start and End times\n",
    "Adding a `--start-time` and `--end-time` flag lets you set start and end times to your archive search. These require dates in the format YYYY-MM-DD.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "twarc2 search --archive --limit 100 --start-time \"2019-01-04\" --end-time \"2019-01-06\" \"vegan OR vegetarian OR plant-based\" vegan.jsonl\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Location search\n",
    "finally we can add reducing by location. This is one of Twitters built-in operators and so it must go in the search term, rather than be a flag for twarc. We add `point_radius:[lon,lat,radius]`, see the below example. You can use a tool like [this](https://www.latlong.net/) to find the lon/lat needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "twarc2 search --archive --limit 100 --start-time \"2019-01-04\" --end-time \"2019-01-06\" \"vegan OR vegetarian OR plant-based point_radius:[-0.127758 51.507351 5mi]\" vegan.jsonl\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Or a Place search\n",
    "```\n",
    "twarc2 search --archive --limit 100 --start-time \"2019-01-04\" --end-time \"2019-01-06\" \"vegan OR vegetarian OR plant-based place:london\" vegan.jsonl\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "So that's everything we need. There are some additional rules you can use based on your API tier [here](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/premium/rules-and-filtering/operators-by-product)\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's run this one last time to collect our data.\n",
